=== Consultation Meeting AI-Powered Recording Devices Privacy and Personal Productivity ===

Okay, it's a recording device. You have to charge it? No, it just draws battery out of your phone. You charge it separately. But what it does, I'm just trying it for fun. It uses AI to summarize it after it records you. It records everything we said, and it will give you a summary. What I was trying to do is maybe trying to use the transcript to try to generate more information. For example, one of my friends was saying, you can try to analyze how much energy you have when you talk with different people.
And during the day, how much time you spend on each different task. But ideally, you want to turn it on all the time. But I feel like it's kind of weird. There's another product from this company. Basically, it's kind of like a moon necklace. And then you can just turn it on all the time. But still, I feel like when you go to work, for example, it's just so weird if you leave it on all the time. So sometimes, maybe during the meeting, I will turn it on.
Yeah, you probably shouldn't do that. Yeah. It's kind of like privacy. Yeah. Yeah, I think you have to ask then because like for my company they said Oh whenever you want to record something you have to ask the person to get a permission, Maybe like Amazon. It's more even more serious. I guess about the privacy. Yeah.
Who do you want to sit? Yeah, yeah, I think, It's just they want to make it easy to do the recording, And you can also do it on your phone, but you need to go it here. You just press it.
I'm not sure I would use it all the time. One thing I do think I can use is like if I'm learning a watching video at home, like for example, watching, learning something new, it will also help me summarize it later. It's basically like another kind of notes. No, like notes, like learning, study notes. But yeah, I won't tell my manager, I was recording whatever he said yesterday. But I mean, I'm just trying for it how it was. I think ideally you want to know like how different people respond, right?
When you're in a meeting, working with people, you want to see what's their thinking process, right? And then maybe you are kind of like doing a prediction model for everyone, knowing like, oh, what's this person might say? I mean, and then you want to make maybe, I think trying to have something of your own where you think the best. But I know it's not everyone is like a model. It's just interesting idea. Some people are having the idea of saying like doing just trying to learn how it's better.
for the mental health for example if if you want to do something like self-growth you want to know whatever things you said today it might also be a good device and so there are also like other devices thinking about having you know the humane to other than the little pain in front destination there is kind of like a little pain you can put on your chest that you can just take videos all the time as well and asking them questions.
kind of like a little virtual assistant for you you have another person with you all the time and you can ask them like hey where did I put my phone or like where did I put my keys can you remind me what what, person told me about during this meeting something like that that's the ideal final case but I think it's just like a lot of things that is hard in reality like privacy issues.
Now turning left onto 6th Avenue.
I'll just get off, you guys can't head to AJ's place first.
No, no, no, it's okay, it's okay, let's go Yeah, let's go together No, yeah, I mean Why rush? Think about it, let me go to AJ's place Amy, I am first and you are second and then we still need to think where you should like call the call box Right? Let's just go together.
See, I feel like Alexia really doesn't like to bother people I don't like to bother people You never can bother us, Alexia I feel like she always tries to make sure she is the lowest maintenance one, Yeah, and she will, I think sometimes I'm a little bit like that, but yeah, But it's okay, Alexia, you can ask us for things.
Thank you.
He actually texted me an hour ago.
Later I'm going to show you guys whatever the recording device told us. I was on P3 and then the electric car charging. I also like charging here during the weekends. Have you been to Pike Place Market? Yeah. I was thinking like a lot of times I would just charge it here and then go to Pike Place or whatever.
I think it's walking with Coco.
Where are you parking. 
oh yeah the charging right now I know it's either here here or there I need a.
five-star review okay here you go send your address okay okay let's go let's leave it together with Alexia okay already okay.
Do you live in an apartment. 
No, it's a townhouse.
Oh, it's a townhouse. That's so nice.
I think the weather is pretty decent.
Did you buy the townhouse? No, we're renting. Do you like it? Yeah, we love it. I really understand how you felt when you were a kid and your mom wasn't there.
I think my mom was the same type, actually.
Really. 
The thing is, I don't see her treating other people differently. And I grow older and older. I think she puts a lot of pressure on me. Because maybe I have better grades and I have better jobs. And I feel like it's kind of different. Previously, when I wanted something from her, it wasn't that easy. And my dad, he always just gives me money. Because he is so busy with his work, he doesn't even know which closet I want.
Yeah, same here.
but but i still feel like they love me so much i think that's the difference between single child and multiple child because i don't feel like they are yeah i just don't feel like they are, i because there's no other one there's no other people they can love right, just you yeah that's why sometimes i'm thinking if i should have like one kid or two kids because i'm not sure if i can do a really good job balancing.
and i want my kid to be feel like he or she is unconditionally loved by me um. it's just love your brother do you think he gives you enough love to them like to you my brother yeah.
he's very like very korean so he loves me but he's not good at, Showing me his love.
So you do need it when people just explicitly show you the love, their love for you, right? I think that's natural. I mean, I don't want to guess, right? Of course.
So you live here. 
I live by the sea.
This is Sears, right? Have you been here. 
Yeah, I loved it. Oh, yeah. I was like, I can take you here, and then I forgot your husband fucking beyond lives here. I remember when you were saying, like, it's not, like, remember when the other friend living with you? Oh, Gina. Gina, and then she said, like, I was saying, like, she must have said the bad word when, you find beyond because she has to live with you all the time yeah that's why i'm saying that i'm not normally like but the thing is like normally when i'm the thing is like when i say.
swear words i don't feel like i'm really using the swear words meaning because i'm not from here yeah i don't know if you feel the same it's like when i say for example i don't feel like it sounds so bad i feel like it also sounds kind of cute but like if you ask me to say the same thing in mandarin yeah i can never say that i just cannot but yeah i hear you yeah right same here but sometimes i'm like do you guys see the bad thing like no no don't worry especially all the music have like this i'm like yeah i'm the same.
you're the same in what kind of way um like so let's say.
yeah i think it's cute yeah but i would never say the word in korean.
Yeah. I just can't. Yeah, exactly. You feel like, so dirty, like, I feel like, so, so, I know, I feel, yeah.
Because we know the meaning of the word, like, too well, right? So, okay, I can't use, I think. 
fuck, we also know the meaning of the word really well, but I think it's like, when we were growing up, when people talk about that word, they're using too much negative energy, so it's just not a word. It's like a word with a lot of negative energy, but for the fuck word, I feel like we didn't hear so many people talking about that in such a bad way, right? Maybe, for example, our parents didn't say that to us, so that's why I kind of feel like, oh, it's okay to say that. 
right? So, everything has an energy. I need a positive energy. Thank you, you too. And your diamond ring is definitely another positive energy. Thank you.
Oh, yeah, he, he did agree. job oh he loves you so much yeah he's very kind person yeah i'm so happy for you, you'll find the one don't give up there is the one i think yes.
i think yeah i won't give up but i also want to put a lot more focus on myself yeah because i'm the kind of type of person like and i really because basically if i'm your mom you will be so happy because every time when my loved ones want to do whatever they want to do i would try to support them even though it means like maybe sometimes i'm not comfortable because i feel like oh if you really want to do that i'm definitely going to go with you like whatever they want to do, but sometimes when you're with this guy like uh i don't think they cherish it that much for example.
my ex-boyfriend in the beginning he was cherishing it he was telling me he thinks we were it was the best time for me to be with my ex-boyfriend he was telling me he thinks we were it was the best time of his life, with me but then he just got used to it he just didn't cherish it that much for, example he won't do the same thing to me as at the same thing I did I will always be there for him always whatever whatever he like but he won't be here for me that fuse and I'm just trying to see like what if another one every time.
when I find someone if I always try to put too much heart effort into it but it didn't turns out to work like I didn't get it back what about but that's another thing basically if I want unconditional love I should just get without thinking about it but when they don't treat you unconditionally as you do you still feel bad so it's still conditional I don't know it's hard for me to overcome this yeah why do you feel bad I feel bad when they are not treating me the way I want.
then you can communicate with him because he's not you right you're too bad.
different person I think the worst thing is that even if after I communicate with them is I still don't get what I want oh yeah I think so maybe yeah maybe that's the worst thing that could happen for example if I tell Toby I oh like for my birthday gift this year I want you to just write me a software or something like that I know you're really good at coding but he might not just do it he might do something else he might do the things he thinks is the best for.
example he might paint me something but because he likes painting but I told him explicitly I want to it's an app it could be a website whatever like I know he cares about his time so I want him to do something that uses his time but for him he just won't do it for example when I say oh today I'm just really craving for, Oysters, can you go to oysters and he was like, oh, can you go by yourself? Oh, yeah, because he has plans already.
He just doesn't like it. He doesn't like oysters. Yeah.
When I say let's go to play laser tag. I really want to try it. He might also say oh I'm just he might just use it. Whatever. He doesn't want to do something, He will just give me a lot of excuses which makes me feel like sometimes it's so hard for me To ask him to do something and that's give me a trauma I think it's the same as your mom basically then I stop asking because I know whenever I ask Maybe he will use another way to try to say. Oh, what about I give you I'll help you over and you go yours by yourself.
He always doesn't not directly align with your request, but give you he also doesn't want to decline totally so he give you partial solution, but then you feel like, Is that that difficult? It's not, Right, you can spend like, hours playing your computer games can you just like take two hours with me let's go to play laser tag or something else I know it's not maybe you didn't enjoy that much but at least we can try it out I think maybe it's the same trauma.
I but I still see that he wants to support you like think this way he's asking you to do things that you don't like to do so let's say hey baby let's go for running and you don't like running and then you would say hey I just sit here and cheer you up why don't you go running by yourself you know so what I am hearing is and it's totally fine two of you guys have different.
hobbies that you like to do and it's totally fine two of you guys have different hobbies that you like to do and it's totally fine two of you guys have different hobbies that you like to do and it's, Then do what you like to do and let him do what he likes to do and then try to find the common, you know, common hobbies. It can be climbing, it can be game, like online game, or it can be like long walk. Then if you ask, hey babe, I want, I feel like our connection is pretty weak this week. Do you want to go for a long walk and chat about, you know, our relationship?
Then I'm sure he will say yes, because if he likes walking. But if you ask, hey babe, let's go eat oysters. And you know he doesn't like oysters, then maybe he could feel that, oh, she doesn't care about me. Yeah, because she knows that I don't like oysters and she knows that I don't like, like, laser gun. But she keeps asking me to do things that I don't like to do. Then he might think that, oh, she doesn't care about me.
what I like to do at my free time you know I think this happens in the later stage where it's already in the beginning stage when I feel like he wasn't giving me enough and then I starting to become someone I don't that didn't like myself as well basically I was keep asking and asking I sometimes I just you're right I know he was uncomfortable but I just want to see that he is willing to make the sacrifice I'm also kind of like manipulating a little bit that just I think because I got hurt before mm-hmm and yeah I know.
that's why in the end I feel like I also didn't like the me because I wasn't able to like love him unconditionally mm-hmm back then like other hours third time when we were together we broke up two times three times and then during the third time I just I still love him and I feel like I couldn't really like say oh babe I'm willing to do anything for him because I some how it feels like he wasn't willing to do anything for me because I some how it feels like he wasn't willing to do anything for me because I some how it feels like he wasn't.
be there when I need him mm-hmm did you say that to him.
I told him that.
What did he say. 
He said he knew he was not doing the right thing because basically there was one time when I was moving, multiple times, basically when I was moving he thinks Uber was too expensive and he thinks I have a roommate back then so he don't have to help me move and packing. He needs to do his own homework back then. But it just took me a really long time to do the packing and everything and basically.
I just repacked until like 2 or 3 am that night and when I went to, oh another thing is like I have my cat with me. He was originally he was saying like, oh when you finish today, tonight, just finish the, day and sleep in my apartment. Because then you don't need to sleep in my apartment. your own apartment where you need to unpack everything right but then I have.
a cat he doesn't like Yoko and I said can I bring Yoko he said what about you just leave Yoko alone at the new house and then you just come to my place but you know as a cat they always get so scared like in a new environment so I cannot leave Yoko alone at a new environment and I said can I bring Yoko he said oh no you cannot bring Yoko what's the problem just like leaving, Yoko just alone at your apartment basically he wants the most efficient and most easy way for him all the time and then it's hard for him to do the.
compromise but back then I couldn't leave Yoko alone because he got so scared of all the new environments did you explain that to him I told him I explained that to him and he still doesn't want it yeah he still doesn't want it and then I just I said never mind I'll just like stay in my I will just go to my new apartment and when I arrived at my new apartment, apartment was like 4 a.m that night and I realized like the bed like was installed in the wrong way basically the workers like helping me move install the bathroom in the wrong way so I need to.
reinstall it and reinstall it myself at 4 a.m oh no it was so scary like yeah because the, it was a new place I also feel really scared and that weird sound like the wind was so loud outside and that's the time when I feel like I really didn't get help like what's the meaning of having a boyfriend like he because I feel like for and then in the beginning I won't care like if he wasn't there for me for me for the tiny teeny things because I feel like everyone should.
have their own interests but that time it makes me really feel like that's the time I really need him but he wasn't there and um yeah and then I got really sad and later he become better for example there was one you, We still live separately, like last year, and then there was one time in the morning I was telling him I feel really, really bad, and then fall back to sleep after I called.
him. Then he come to my home directly to check me if I was fine or if I fainted. I was having bad period pain. I just basically kind of fainted because I was really bad. But on the bed, I fell asleep again. I really want him to stay with me for the entire day, but he only stayed with me for another two or three hours. He was like, oh, now I need to go to work, but he didn't have to because back then he could stay with me, but he just think I'm here for two hours, that's it.
And then that's, it just feels weird. I feel like whenever he give, he doesn't want to give everything to you. He always like give a little bit. It's not new thing. I feel like he doesn't care. He still cares. He still give to you. even come to me but he only can give you a little and maybe he's scared he's.
scared yeah of keeping all of himself to you because then it's up to you right you can hurt him I never have hurt him before but he doesn't know and you know some guys are like that they're like very anxious about giving love yeah I.
think it's I was thinking maybe the way he raised up because his parents didn't give him a lot maybe that's why he didn't maybe he's scared yeah that's why like in the end I feel like the thing is like we both love each other I know he also loves me a lot but it's just not the way I want it so I was basically saying like it's okay like let's just try to not be together because it's kind of torture both of us like we still love each other, but sometimes it's just like it's okay it's okay sometimes like.
of us are manipulating each other yeah it's kind of sad I think it's just though why you to love each other it's just didn't end up working but still it's a good memory right I think whatever this what is a good ending right it's good ending just getting married or having a kid or living together until the death you never know I mean as long as I have good memory missing five years I mean.
some memories are not good but beautiful time I think that's a full relationship already it doesn't have to say oh yeah so you know it is part of the point.
journey but do you feel like you can make it work with him no no I try so.
much, Yeah, I tried really hard. Yeah, I think I'm afraid of getting hurt, Hey, I think this just not all relationships will ends up to be.
It's just like say the Mexican guy. Oh, yeah You two love each other so much as well but then to ride on to sometimes, It just doesn't work out. Yeah. It's not perfect, but nothing is not everything has to be perfect, right. 
That's what I'm doing turn left on to the 15th Avenue East. She can't believe to read this. Now turn right onto East Thomas Street. This is right at Lexia.
It was so funny. I was trying to find someone who tarot cards reading. And then she was saying like, oh, so did you have a bad relationship starting from 2019? She knew? Yeah, I think. She somehow used the tarot card and the star sign. She calculated and I was like, how do you know? And then she said, oh, it's supposed to end in two years. But because you were the one insisting, so that's why it lasts for five years.
Oh, yeah. Now turn right onto 19th Avenue East.
I never believed in tarot cards.
I know. And I was like, wow, that's so interesting. So maybe it's just like in China, like the old saying, it's kind of like fate, right? Just not this person. And I need to learn something from this relationship. After I broke up, I started to develop a lot of my own interests. For example, I bought a car last year.
I used to always like take other people's car because I didn't feel like I could drive. But now I could drive. I love it so much. And I'm starting to play pickleball, everything, having new friends. Can I just park it here? Yeah.
Oh, I don't know. I don't think so. This is the... Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Now your destination is on the right.
I think this one should be fine. It's not. Let me see.
Your destination is on the right.
Can you go? In that car, he has a... He has a... Uh... Yeah, this thing. It's out of work, I guess. Yeah, without that, I think I could be able to make it work.
Yeah, it's too tight. It's too tight. Yeah. I'm just gonna go. Okay. I'm sure there are lots of parking space. Maybe. I think so. What is happening? Oh. Hm? Oh, shit. Why? I don't know.
I need to, I can't, I have no way to let him, I don't know, like on that side, I don't know how to park on that side, I'll just like, can you build a guide, let's see, where can we go, where is the little Alexa parking, it's so hard to park on a slope, because sometimes, in my slit, right, there's a really nice bingsu place, in Kato, do you like bingsu, I love bingsu, sometimes, not all the time though, I guess it's also sweet, right, are you trying to. 
control or sugar do you think this yeah i'm like i'm not i can eat sweet things but not all the time.
guy is leaving oh yeah all right perfect good like lucky you.
now turn right onto east medicine street.
I sometimes think about, like, just wheel, switch, you know, like, turns, and then, like, you know what I'm saying? Like, that way. I wish. You wish? Yeah. That kind of technology.
But, like, when I do the parallel parking, I couldn't think. It's okay. I think I can just do like this. Oh, yeah. Perfect. It's perfect. It's always so hard to adjust a...

Your Task:
Step 1: Transcript Segmentation and Context Identification
Carefully read the provided transcript. Divide it into distinct, meaningful events or episodes. Identify context shifts based on:
- Changes in topic
- Changes in location (if inferable from audio cues or explicit mentions)
- Changes in people Wei is interacting with
- Significant time gaps or clear transitions in activity
Each event should represent a cohesive block of activity or interaction.

Step 2: Structured Event Analysis (JSON Output)
For each individual event identified in Step 1, generate a structured analysis in JSON format. The output should be a JSON array of event objects with the following structure:
[
  {
    "event_id": "unique_event_identifier_001",
    "event_title": "A concise summary of what happened",
    "time_range": "Approximate start and end time (e.g., '07:00-07:30')",
    "duration_minutes": 30,
    "mood_labels": ["primary_mood", "secondary_mood"],
    "mood_score": 7,
    "stress_level": 3,
    "energy_level": 8,
    "activity_type": "work|exercise|social|learning|self-care|chores|commute|meal|leisure",
    "people_involved": ["Name1", "Name2"],
    "interaction_dynamic": "collaborative|supportive|tense|neutral|instructional",
    "inferred_impact_on_wei": "energizing|draining|neutral",

    "context_summary": "Brief description of what was happening",
    "key_quote_or_moment": "A relevant quote or significant moment"
  }
]

Step 3: Daily Summaries and Visualization Data
Based on the JSON data generated in Step 2, provide:

Overall Daily Scores:
- Daily Mood Score: Calculate a duration-weighted average of mood_score
- Daily Stress Level Score: Calculate a duration-weighted average of stress_level
- Daily Energy Level Score: Calculate a duration-weighted average of energy_level

Energy Level Timeline:
- Provide as an array of [timestamp, energy_level] pairs

Mood Distribution:
- For each primary mood_label, calculate total duration_minutes

Awake Time Allocation:
- Calculate total duration_minutes for each activity_type

Social Interaction Summary:
- For each unique person:
  - Total interaction time
  - Overall inferred impact
  - Key observation about interaction

Topic Analysis:
- List topics with frequency and duration
