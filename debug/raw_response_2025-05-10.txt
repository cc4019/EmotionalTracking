=== Consultation Meeting Family Dynamics Work Motivation and Social Planning ===

Okay, now, I woke up this morning and fell asleep again. I found that I couldn't sleep well in the morning, so I fell asleep. I feel that my aunt is a little sensitive. For example, I would think if there is anyone to send me messages. Some people didn't reply to me. What is the reason? I found that my aunt was very afraid of people sending me messages.
So I felt very sensitive. I was thinking about how to make myself less sensitive. Maybe I should read books. You know, all the things about me. These are the journey of others. Don't always think that you did something wrong. Don't think about pleasing others. This is really one of my problems. I was wrong. It's not my fault, but why is it that other people can be unhappy all the time?
And then I always have to think about why others are unhappy, this is not right. I just have to stick to my own thoughts, I don't have to be a kind person, but I have to stick to my heart, I am very good to myself. Yes, stick to my own thoughts, and then I don't care. Okay, I'm going home now, I just got home, because I just went downstairs to get the transcript. I'm going to work for a while, and then I'm going to have barbecue with everyone at night.
I'm listening to music now. Okay, she's here.
It's hard to work because it seems to be a little less exciting and fun. I'm thinking about what kind of job I really want to do. I need to do the job I really like. I don't need music, because my dopamine can be secreted by enough dopamine. But when I feel that my work is not that interesting, I have to listen to music.
Only then can I have a good dopamine to do this work. But to be honest, at that time, I didn't have much motivation, and it wasn't good. But, ah, work, whatever, is really that important.
Thank you.
Oh, my goodness.
Wow, he looks so handsome from the beginning. Wow, his fingers are so strong. Oh my god, baby.
Thank you. 千万别想起我 头红飞过处远点.
Thank you.
I love you so much.
What should I do? I can't get out of it. I'm pretending to answer for you now. Like a silly confession, I didn't let you go. I don't know how to say it, but I don't know how to say it.
Thank you.
I feel like when I'm on PMS, I often can't control what I need to do with my phone to play games. Maybe the best time is to go out.
until the end. See you again.
I don't know what I'm talking about, but I don't know what I'm talking about.
Thank you.
Wow, Linzi I was thinking about tonight, because originally, Yexin asked me if I wanted to celebrate my new job. And I thought maybe I wanted to invite guests. So I thought last time, every time I invited guests, you were not there. You and Wang Junxin. So do you want to go? If I invite guests. But we have something to do tonight. Do you know that our family came to seal? I didn't tell you.
We are dealing with this recently. So I guess we have to do it in the afternoon. Yexin mentioned it to me. She said your family has a storm. But I don't know if your sister has solved it. No, it's not. So thank you. You can eat first. It's okay. You don't have to worry about inviting guests. She asked me last week. Then I agreed. But I forgot. She reminded me last night. So I remembered. And we don't really eat grilled fish. We don't eat grilled fish at home. Why? So you can eat first.
Why don't you eat grilled fish? It's not that I don't eat grilled fish. It's that I don't think about it. We all go to Vancouver to eat. Okay. Let me think about it. What time do you guys finish your dinner? I think it's pretty good. About 20 minutes. I'm going to drive. I was going to drive there too. Take a shower.
We don't want to eat your food. It's because this week because of the bees it's a bit sad. I'm still, very busy. I thought you guys didn't eat last time. I was thinking, because he said he was going to celebrate. I thought I was going to treat the guests. You guys didn't eat. If you're not in a hurry today, but you've already said that you're going to eat first. It doesn't matter.
Then we'll eat first today. Anyway, you still have a lot of opportunities to invite us. Thank you. It's okay. I'll just ask you again. Then you guys get on with your bees. It sounds scary. Yes. You don't have to think about it. Okay, okay. Bye bye.
Hey, Youkou! She closed her eyes and stepped on the milk. Did you see that? Youkou! I saw that. Happy. Youkou! If you're happy, it means you're happy. If you're happy, it's okay, Youkou. Youkou! My dad, just left. He just left.
After that, I wanted to take a long-distance bus back. My dad said it's better to drive by yourself. I don't have much big stuff with me. It's also good to take a bus. It takes two hours to get there. It's a long-distance bus. Youkou! You're happy. Look at this. If you drive, what if you get sleepy?
I can't sleep in the morning or in the afternoon. Youkou! Youkou! I can hear you from the corner of my mouth. Youkou! You didn't go out for dinner, did you? I ate dinner. Who did you go out with?
I went out with Yexin. Yexin? Yexin and Xinyi. What did you eat in the morning? I ate the leftovers from yesterday. Where did you eat the leftovers? I cooked dumplings. Dumplings can't be delicious.
Um, um.
What do you want to eat? I want to eat a bucket of sweet potatoes. A bucket of sweet potatoes. I want to eat a bucket of sweet potatoes. I want to stay at home and do my job. I want to eat half-cooked sweet potatoes.
Why? I want to eat half-cooked sweet potatoes. Sweet potatoes are delicious.
After that, I had to go to the theater. Did someone play with you? Yes, he could come out at night. He couldn't come out during the day. Because his children were in charge. He could come out to play at night. Why did you bring the child back? I didn't. Fu Yidong watched it while he was sleeping. His grandpa watched it at home. That's pretty good.
But the wife, doesn't care. The child doesn't care at all. What do you call that? It's really disgusting. It's a bit... It's like a musical instrument. The child doesn't care. I'm afraid it will affect her. There are very few mothers in the world who are like this. This is what happens when you kiss a woman.
When a man kisses a woman, the child doesn't care. That's like a mother. Yeah, you see, it's normal for old people to like their children, isn't it? Yeah. But old people don't like their mothers either. You see, their mothers play by themselves all the time. Yeah. But they don't let their children play by themselves. They play by themselves. The people of Shanghai are rural.
Yeah. The situation is still poor. It's possible. They are afraid of having a bad time. You see, having a bad time with their children. How can you be like this? Yeah. Yes. If you want to go to work, you can go to your parents' house. You can take two bags of.
I know. What did you eat last time? Grilled fish. I had grilled fish at home last time. Oh, you had grilled fish at home last time. That's good. Every time you come here, you have to wait for a few days. I remember that month, you came here on the 6th. Last month, I think it was around the 8th. I remember last month, you came here on the 6th. What did you say?
You came here on the 6th. You have to wait for a few days. I think so. I feel like I've reached the bottom of the valley. You've reached the bottom of the valley. When you reach the bottom of the valley, what do you feel? When you listen to music, you think about other things. Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah. I don't know what to do with my brain. This little thing, there's nothing else. There's nothing else. Your dad gave me a bunch of water. I drank it in the afternoon. It was too slippery. Before I came back, the water was too big. I had to clean it up. Why? The water was too big. I had to wash the flowers. This one doesn't go.
I have to water it. These two days, I have to walk. I have to walk. I have to walk six times a week. Today is Mother's Day. Today is Mother's Day? I don't know. Wait a minute. Today is Mother's Day? Yes.
I forgot about this. You can just forget about it. I'm the one who forgot about it. Even if you forget about it, I'll forget about it too. I really don't know. I feel like I forgot about it. You forgot about it. I forgot about it too. I forgot about it myself. I don't know. I only feel like I forgot about it because they sent me a message. We don't care about the ceremony every day. We give you Mother's Day every day, right? Why should I give you Mother's Day?
I don't know. Your daughter will take you out to play when it's not your holiday. You scared me to death. You have such a good daughter. She will play with you and spend money on you. Right? Of course not. I love my mom like my mom is my child. I like my mom very much.
Right? You treated me like a child. Of course not. You said I was your child. You are my child. You scared me to death. No. I think sometimes you are like a child. Mom, I have to play with you. Otherwise, I will be completely old. Right? Play with you.
Okay. I like the way you play with me. Really? I forgot about it. My brain... I don't know. Maybe these two days it's okay to change my mind. I always feel that sometimes I still don't have that much energy. You know, you said you can't be so happy all of a sudden. It's okay. There's no such thing as... There's no such thing as.
you can do anything easily. You can do anything easily. Yes. You can do anything easily. Yes, I think so too. Yes. Actually, our family is very lucky. Isn't it? Our family is very lucky.
After that, it's better than nothing. It's not a big deal. It's almost enough. It's okay to think about it. Yes, you can make money. After that, it's not that you have to work all day. You can work three or five days a week. That's enough. What do you want? That's right.
You're right. Your mother is right. I don't want to soak in the water. Yes, I want to soak in the water.
What is it? It's the water from the flowers and the peppers. Yeah, it's quite interesting. Yeah, it's the water from the flowers and the peppers. It's the water from the flowers and the peppers. Oh, my little mom. What are you doing on Mother's Day?
I'm going to play football. That's good. I'm going to play football with your mom. What are you doing? Can't you eat? I'll give you 800 yuan to eat something delicious. Your money is my money. My mom paid $1,500 for the phone. Did you see that the phone was less than $1,500?
I didn't see it. I didn't see the balance either. After that, I spent $1,500. This is the money for the visa. It's good to get a visa this time. You don't need to bring a passport. This is a good point. What's wrong with the money you gave me? My mom didn't give her $800. Yes. My mom doesn't lack this money, does she?
Yes. Explain. It's okay. You just need to know that I love you. Why don't you love me? If you don't love me, who can you love? You can only love a few people. Husband, child, parents. You must love them. 挺好,哎呀,早上有点事情,昨天一晚上叫睡得挺时生,睡得也挺快,没吃那个什么药,这水跟着混着,就是臭点,但是听不一样,再给这壶水,我再给它盛点水,等着吃,完了之后再给它,就让它都臭了,就发酵了之后浇花,然后花长成肥状,肥状,挺好的妈妈,
我等会儿准备,我车牌过期了,我刚更新了车牌,每年更新车牌你猜多少钱,交了, How much is it? 800 yuan. Is it scary? It's like updating the license plate. The license plate is given to you once a year. Not every year. This is a annual discount, isn't it? Yes. Isn't this like the annual discount of cars in the United States?
It should be a annual discount. Yes, it is estimated to be a annual discount. Our annual discount is more than 100 yuan a time. It doesn't check. It just lets you update the license plate. Then it's called 800 US dollars. Yes. Right? Yes. It's like... I washed your dad's hair.
After washing it, there's a whole thing here. The nose is like this. I'll wash it later with Yang Laba. I'll wash it later.
I tried it several times. But I couldn't catch it. I tried it several times. But I couldn't catch it. How did you fall? I fell down. It was very low, not very high. You fell down? It was okay. It wasn't that high. It was pretty good.
Am I pretty good? Pretty good. So far away. I was so naughty when I was little. When you were little, your naughty side was shown. Pretty good. Right?
I was so naughty when I was little. Isn't it because you had hyperhidrosis? You were naughty because you had too much energy. I played with it every day. Was it hyperhidrosis? There's a little bit of it. It has something to do with Duodengzheng. Because Duodengzheng has too much energy. There's no way for him to stay at home. I think it's better to stay at home. It's better for you. The kids are all better. Yes. If you don't know how to do it,
you can't do anything about it. Yes. They didn't study well afterwards. That's right. They didn't study well. The parents don't care. Gao Meixi's family seems to be in a lot of trouble. What's wrong with her? She's in a lot of trouble. Is she in a lot of trouble?
Yes. She's in a lot of trouble. How much money did you make? I think I made a lot of money at that time. Now I feel like I don't have much money, right? Yes. I lost a lot of money.

They also take pictures with mom. Liu Ke. Mom, let's take a picture together. Mom, I can't. I can't be on the camera. I think it's ugly. I didn't wash my hair, didn't wash my eyes, I didn't wash my hair, didn't wash my eyes I can't breathe.

I immediately jumped into the water to save my mom.
You see, in my dream, I was so anxious. I even saved her twice. In my dream, I saved her twice. It was like my house. Now it's not the 11th floor. Isn't it the air below? It was like in my dream. It's still the design of my house. But it's just the sea outside. Then it's just water.

There is one in the kitchen drawer. You can see it when you go there. Kitchen. There is one in the bathroom drawer. Which one do you think it is? I didn't find it.
Let me see. It's in the pocket. It's in the pocket of the paper. It's in the pocket of the food container. Yes, it's in the pocket of the food container. Look at the bottom. Turn it over. Three boxes. It's not three boxes. There is another one.
This one? This one? I'll take one. I'll take one.
What does that mean? I'll search it up and I'll know. It's an egg. Which one? The one in the middle is dead. Then I forgot. Oh, Oreo! Yes, Oreo. Oreo.
Oreo is American. I can't remember. I don't think it's good. They all like to eat the inside. It's good. I like it too. It's black and bitter. Does it taste good? No. Not bad. I'll have another one. 去吧,我收拾收拾,我洗洗脸去。
你看刚刚勇口说个再见吧。 勇口啊,勇宝子,别跟他混吃的了哦,怕不得行了哦,勇口啊。 天天就混那口吃的哦,只要是在我跟前你要看不住啊,那我天天他愿吃啥就给他吃啥。 可不这样,因为他已经瘦了,我觉得。 当时你咋给勇口都整胖了,勇口都瘦了。 是啊,他还能那么明显呢,你就赖我,你天天。
好像是有点瘦了,勇口啊,你白天上班吧,最后你就给他搁那不愿吃的干粮,孩子他就瘦了。 乐的他就乐的,对,你就给他不愿吃的干粮,掺几个粒好的。 After that, he automatically lost weight. That little Yueyue, Wang Yijia's little Yueyue, now has a lot of coughs. She lost a lot of weight. But she ran outside every day. Wang Yijia doesn't even need to feed the cats.
They all get in the car outside. Follow the cat to the field outside. The cats don't even need to feed the cats. They can run. Oh, okay, go ahead. You go ahead, I'll take care of the cat. I'll take care of the cat all day long. If you're going to make a fuss all day long, I'll take care of your dad.
I won't think about it.
I don't know.
Yeah.
Right, learn something new. It's your part of the power, you have to deal with it well. That's the situation. There will be problems. You don't need to worry about it. Do you understand your girl? Your girl is always worried about her friends. I don't think I'm good to others with a purpose. For example, I'm not good to the boss. But when others are down, when my friends are down, I'm always worried about them. So you want me to say...
Yes, but sometimes you can't be too silly. You have to be beautiful. You have to be yourself. Right? You can be silly. But now... When I was young, I was very honest. Now I feel a little bit... I observe him.
假设我对你王姨,我看她对我要真好,我对她好,她跟我争点事争点啥,那我就得琢磨着,但是她们跟我自己哪有吃亏的,都没吃着亏,都借着我光了,你说你王姨说好,这她借咱家多些光了,我帮她多些忙呢, 完了再说吃着喝着,每次吃着喝着,拿着去,有啥吃着喝着都想着你她,她就说我对她好,有啥吃着喝着都给她,要不她大天早起来给我包包子,她那个懒鸭,就说我对她好,
王姨也是,但你说有的时候你就帮别人,有的人也不是真这样,王姨跟我是一个性格,就掏心掏肺,比较善良, 有些人你帮吧, 她也不一定,未必是这样的,那确实是,我爸就有的时候讲了帮,帮个这个帮,那你催大的,就我觉得他们这个那现在是, I don't want to help anyone. After helping others, I feel very sad. There is such a thing. I also have such a thing.
Some people are really like this. Some people say there is a person in Xiaohongshu who said that his nephew, his second aunt, a relative's child, said that the kidney was broken and needed to be plastic surgery. They pulled a bunch of people around to do plastic surgery. Then it happened that he got plastic surgery. But it was a relative. His child got plastic surgery. Then he asked if he wanted to donate the kidney. He said that it could save people's lives. Then others could... But then everyone on the Internet.
commented that in fact, Mo Da's kindness is very similar to Mo Da's grudge. Sometimes. Because if he can't repay the kindness, he will start to worry about you. Don't think that everyone is indebted to you. Then I was thinking that if something like this happened in our family, I would definitely... I still can't... You can't just let your family donate to someone else. Because you seem to be kind. Because you really need this money. But who needs this money? It's not easy for your family to do this. Yes, I think so too. I think it's really... For example, I'm willing to do it with my parents. And then maybe it's okay to do it with siblings. You can't do it with your parents. Why? Your parents are all grown up.
No matter how old you are, you can't do it. Right? Yes. No, no, no. 那不是,不是。
. . .
Um.
That's not good. Wait a minute. I'll go to the... You go. Mom, no. I'll... What? What is it? I said that if we really donate, but we don't need to discuss it now. But I think my parents are really important to me. I don't think it's a big deal. It's not that it's not a big deal. It has nothing to do with us. We don't discuss this kind of thing. My mother-in-law said, what's wrong with these things?
It has nothing to do with our parents. What are you talking about? I don't know.
. . . . .
Bye-bye. I don't know, I don't know where to start. I don't know.
I don't know what to say. I don't think so. Maybe it's because of the traffic. There is no one who really agrees to be a parent.
Come on, cheers. Honey, you're back. KK, you're back. What do you want to drink? I'm fine. I'm here for my aunt. I just want to eat something. Then go and make some brown sugar water. And then I'll give you a warm hug. You're so gentle and considerate. When are you going to take a class and teach our family how to make gourd? Sure, I'll give you a friendly price. KK, I really envy you. Come on, Wu Yi, where are you going?
We're going to Jiangsu. Honey, slow down. Drink some water. Where is Wu Yi going now? There are a lot of people. Hello. Your wine is here. Your security guard won't let you in. Go down and get it. Okay, I got it. Get the wine, right? Honey, when you get down to get the wine, you must wear more clothes. It's cold outside. Be careful of getting a cold. I'm going to get it.
Go. The wine is quite heavy, okay? Let's go. We haven't finished drinking. Just let him go. Let's go. Go out and breathe some air for me. Let's go. Slow down. You're going to fall. You're quite meticulous. How can I be meticulous? There must be a meticulous person in the family. Otherwise, I'll be in trouble all at once. The plane is here. Be careful on the road. I won't see you off. I'm going to the toilet. Okay. Then we'll leave first. Is this your new ring? It's so pretty. This is the three-year-old gift he gave me. It's pretty, right? It's pretty. It's a little diamond. It's shiny. It's exquisite. It's not vulgar.
He said it's a natural diamond. It's said that every diamond is broken after a hundred million years. And it's unique. Just like our love. The only one. Under time, it will only shine and shine. It won't change for a long time. Is it romantic? Don't look at it. It's usually less. But it's a lot of action. Tomorrow, I'll buy you one. The price of diamonds is super suitable. Okay. Don't you think it hurts? It's because it's not on him. Oh my god. There's too much oil. Pei Pei. Honey. When you wash your hands, remember to wear gloves, or you'll hurt your hands. Also, remember to wear a scarf. Don't get your clothes dirty. What's wrong? Your toothpick is in your hand. Let me see. Hurry up.
Thank you, wife.
Wife, get me a bottle of water.

It's a good way to celebrate, isn't it? Just gather up, And then when I have something to do every day I also feel like I'm stupid all day Otherwise, if I stay at home all day and have a long time, I won't be stupid Especially if it's alone, it's quite uncomfortable, And then I want to go to Nordstrom to see the earring I've been losing my earring lately It feels like a disaster-free disaster. Every time I think about it, every time I have this disaster.
I feel like he blocked me from a disaster I'm pretty happy, aren't you?

Thank you.
I don't know what to say.
试过你不见天空休. 试过天花天望更望, 顺着青草. 然若你无谓结果.
我便早已做干扣. 又便留重山万里. 无闻情拙都心中. 假借时日无多. 沿途风纵过往不久. 愿我们烂在一宿好梦. 岁月几千永如愁.
I don't know.
假借时无多 也放纵不去 满载一宿好梦. 岁月提前又如愁 逃学往后.
若你已落 心的谱中 还是惦记结果, 字只说 用谁掌舵 人也分.
It's super pretty.
You sing, you sing Then everyone says You, you Don't want to be the kind of person who does bad things.
Habit, habit The world's rules are half and half, But it's not easy to be hurt inside. 起飞 起飞 云层岸丢在后腿 或许回家我在某海面 夕阳马上去看 晴雨才不早 晴雨才不早.
One moment, one moment, you're the only one who knows, you're just a screw that fell off. One day, one day, doing the same thing over and over again, saving, saving, forgetting, and then starting a new day.

I want to eat that... I want Jinjiao chicken. Is this spicy? This is from Guizhou Suntang. It sounds spicy.

It's spicy because it has millet pepper in it, so it should be spicy, and then you can choose a spicy one from this and that beef oil.

Isn't there a yellow one underneath? Then I went down. I felt that I was a little closer to yellow. Then I went up. Wow, that's great. It's a new one. It's a new one. Last time, I don't know if you remember, but there was one that was a little out of balance, and he took that one apart.

It doesn't look like this. It can be two more. Last time my mom... Didn't my mom like to eat a... quail egg? I don't think so. When will your mom come next time? I don't know. Maybe in a short time. My mom is so funny. What is it? She said that... she thinks our life is too hard. She filmed a video for me. It's a little bit hard.
My mom lives here too. It's expensive. She told me... I took a picture with them and they spent 30 yuan on it. I'll just go ahead and sit here. We'll do another cart ride. Yes, let's go. My mom thinks so too. Because they don't have to spend money on food over there. This is for my mom.

I can't wait to try it.
I don't know if you can hear me, but there's a lot of people here, so I'm going to take a look at them one by one, and I'm going to take a look at them one by one.
There's a lot of people, but I don't think it's a lot of people, but I think it's a lot of people, but I think it.
I don't think there's any problem with that. I think it's fine. It's fine.
This is the first time I've been to this restaurant, and I've never been to a restaurant like this before, so I'm very excited to try it.
I don't know.
Ew, here I am!
So I don't know if it's a little bit better than I thought, but I think it's a little bit better than I thought, but I think it's a.

I don't know.
I was just standing on the other side. So where's Thomas?
Oh, I see. I think it will be more interesting when you see it in real life. Yes, yes, yes. It's not as good as the one in the photo. And the sound. I think the fish skin is the highlight of the day.
Subtitles by the Amara.org community, Oh. Oh.
Thank you.
Yes, I can't do it. I can't do it.
It's really fun. It's exciting. If you want to do it, let's do it together. Let's go on the 3rd. Come back on the 8th. It's exciting. Yeah. It's exciting.
I went there in the summer, but I don't remember what I did there. I forgot. I totally forgot what I did there. I have a good friend. My manager is not feeling well. She asked me to take a two-week leave. I came back at the beginning. Oh my god. I woke up at 4.20 in the morning. I woke up at 11.42 in the evening. How can I sleep? I took a shower. 18 hours a day.
One hour a day. Why are you thirsty today? Are you salty today? Salty. I woke up at 4.40 in the morning. I woke up at 11.30 in the evening. I didn't sleep for five hours. Crazy. This one is super cool. The lighting is very good.
I think you can secretly ask, . . . . . .
Similar people. Yeah, I think you and Shuyi are very similar. LVV Yes, Did you park your car? I rented two cars, When I rented a car, everyone was very anxious Anyway, you insist on two cars You are really worried that the people in the middle can't see the scenery, right? Actually, I've been there twice Have you been in the middle? No I think everyone wants to sit in the window Then the people in the middle will be very aggrieved Because if you drive, the scenery on the roadside is very beautiful.
Then there are often small animals on the roadside Can't see If you are in the middle, you may be seen by others You can't see Then I think it's quite uncomfortable I don't think so I think it's quite good And it's more bright In case you are in the middle, it will be bright, Good point I didn't take it, At that time, LVV was in the middle They have a car Is it bright? Yes, Is it bright? It's the same color as his mother's car, right? No, it's his classmate's car I don't know.
It's yellow But it's bright. Really? That means the two cars are very good, Yes, and I have to put my luggage in the middle. Because I didn't think that a seven-seater might have to put the last row of luggage on the island. Yes, so I can only do two rows. Yes, and I know that everyone says that I don't want to sit in the middle because there are people sitting in the middle. But I'm not happy to see others sitting in the middle. Just like you, right? Yes. We NFPP. In a few days, I will change it to four rooms.
I don't care so much about it. OK. Change to five beds. My bed is a bit difficult. But I think Mu Xin and I will have a lot of things to do. There is a big king bed. I think it will cost a lot of money. It seems that we didn't have a king bed. It's all queen beds. Yes. I always sleep like a cat. This is actually very good. The amount of sleep is also high. For example, you fall asleep as soon as you wake up.
Just like my dad. I'm happy. Thank you. Yeah, it's a good thing. I don't know. Everyone has their own pain points, right? For example, for me, my family is too messy. You have your own problems. My problems are that my family is too messy. After my mom left, I didn't want to clean up. You should find an aunt to clean up. They don't really help you sort things out. Because my family is not dirty. They always help you clean up.
But they don't help you arrange things very well. My mom helps me arrange things very well. I think you might need to find a special housekeeper. Like in Japan. Do you want to be a housekeeper? Then you think about it. How much does it cost? I don't know. How much does it cost? Two or three hundred yuan per person. Is there such a thing? I don't think so. I think there is such a thing. Let's take a look. This is our tea. We make our own tea. There are also guests.
Wow, the price is not cheap.
It's quite expensive when you go back. But I think you should hang it up first. You should try it first. You should hang it up first. You can hang it up first if you don't want to. Oh. Then you can be the supplier of this teahouse. Yes. But they actually feel like working with the teahouse in China. They stick their own cards. They can't source the tea from outside. Yes. But your uncle... No, you are your uncle. He is an uncle. Uncle. This is also a teahouse, right? Yes, they have their own teahouse. Yes. But you are not...
Oh, I don't know. Oh, I don't know. I sent some samples from China last week. Because we wanted to send the samples. We sent the samples. We sent the samples.
Then he asked me about the price of this industry. I told him the price is the same. I told him I bought it in the first season. He said, if you want to go to the DHL in Paris as soon as possible, You have to pay twice as much as the tax. 200 percent. You have to pay twice as much as the tax. I said, I'll change the channel. I'll change the channel and sell it. About three weeks. But it's the kind that pays the tax. So I'm going to do what I can. How much is a knife?
A knife. You have such a big box. Just one knife. Not too much. How about 20 knives? 20 knives. How much is one knife? One knife. One knife is 100 knives. They pay the tax. I used to do the same thing. When I sent something to my family. It can't be more than 1,000 yuan. Then it lets you fill in the value of everything. Then basically, after you fill in the price, it will take the price and calculate the tax for you. So in fact, all your things will be second-hand.
You send it from here. Yes, for example, I buy something for my mother. Buy a fan or a lamp. I can write the original price. 200 yuan, but you won't be able to get away with it, because it's more than 1,000 yuan. Then you can say, second-hand, and you can say 10 yuan. Ah, smart. But it's not easy to get things. Limits. If you buy that kind of health product, you can't open the box, you can't open the box. Because it needs the link of the website.
Then how did you get the link of second-hand? I don't have the link of second-hand. That's why I said about 25 yuan, and I paid half of the price. I didn't dare to give too much. I think it's better to buy it in China now. Yes. Anyway, there are so many things to buy in China now. Otherwise, it's very cheap to learn. Just like this app. Just now, because my sister is a college student.
She said that the most people use this app. Just like that. I bought Nike, Adidas, and other sports brands. Sometimes he asked me, I said I bought it in the US, it's more expensive than you. I don't know what channel they are from.
I was thinking, we're graduating, so we don't need to pay anything. What do you mean $13,000? You've been studying for 4 years, and now you need to pay $1,000 more. You only have $13,000. What do you mean 4 years? It's 9 years. Everyone is going to have to study. Oh, nice. You're not going to study in your major? So all the salaries in the whole country are very high. Just like Homing? Yes. The professors' salaries are very high. How much do you have to pay for your studies? About $200,000 to $200,000.
Chen Shi has to pay $200,000 to study. Chen Shi needs to drink water now. I don't know. I'm a senior. Yu Da is a professor. My boss is Professor Zheng. Yu Da is a coach. Smart? Yes. Seriously? He has more money than a school teacher. Because he's a businessman. He's a football player. A football player.
Huh? Who? What age is she?
It's similar to what we're doing now.
Did he update you with any information? Didn't you say he wouldn't call you? Yes, he said he wouldn't update you Now you're focused on what's going on And my current manager said I want to update you with what's going on next year He kept asking me about it And then I realized I don't know why but. You said you will have a commemorative manager next year.
Yes. Then I was like, why? I don't know. He just grabbed this in his hand. Then I was very dissatisfied with my manager next year. He said I am also a control. I don't want to let him go. I said he is a control freak. Then he said, now we have to hurry up and get him back. So weird. His manager is very good next year. Just keep helping him. Then he said you don't work overtime next year. Yes, if you want to work overtime, you don't have to do those things that you usually have to do. I think it's good to have a manager next year.
Can we start in July? Yes. It's going so fast. It's not that fast. But this year is also very new. There are so many things to do. It's almost half past six o'clock. Yes, it's so fast. I just sent a message to my friends. Your August is almost over. Yes, it's fast. It's almost August. How can it be so fast? I feel a little sad when it comes to August. Let's take a look. 2025. It's already been half a week.
Yes, it's already been half a week. Have you grown up? I think I've grown up. You've grown up too. I think I've become deeper. You've always been deeper. You've grown up too. I don't think I was as deep as I was when I didn't get drunk. You can write poems when you get drunk. Look at Weiwei. He wrote a poem for a friend. After he broke up with him, he wrote a poem.
It's full of words. Is he still selling his poems in Dali? I saw he sent a friend a letter. That's so literary. Let me show you. Where did he sell his poems? In Dali. He was sitting over there. It's only been 3 days, I didn't see it. I didn't see it either. I saw it.
You saw it? I saw the person who wrote the letter. I saw it. You didn't give me the letter. This one, this one, this one. This little girl is very handsome. Wow. It's a street art. But it's straight. It looks like a curve. But it's straight. Really? Very straight. I think it's straighter than me. How can you say that? No. Let me think about it.
How can you say that? Maybe I don't have charm. I don't know what to say. I don't know.
Wow, it's so long. It's so long.
Because he thinks that he doesn't love you. You have to prove that you love me. If I do this, it means that you don't love me. You don't love me enough. He will care a lot about whether you love me or not. But if he doesn't care, he will give this to you and say that you love me. . . . . .
The man was very nice to her. But the man didn't have a good sense of security. But later I found out that... Thank you very much.
Thank you. I don't know, the people around me are dragging me along with them. And I'm just a little bit scared. It's like... I'm just a little bit scared.
Powerful. You are all great.
I think this is a different style. What are you laughing at? Are you laughing at yourself? I don't want to do it, but my hair is still very high. I'm tired. You can do it when you get to work. You don't have to do it. Let him do it. He has a strong sense of humor. It's true that you can eliminate your hair. It doesn't matter. I want to be like this. I'm not like this. You're so naive. What are you talking about? I have eyes, ears, and hands.
You two can also talk on the phone. If we get married, if we get married, If we get married,
I don't know what you're talking about.
I think I'm usually the most confident one. You're the most confident one. You know, my dad always said, when you come back, you'll lose weight. That's why you have to go to the hospital. Anyway, it's a good hospital. Just go there and see what time it is. I'm a human being. You don't have to go to the hospital. There's a kindergarten next to the hospital. The kindergarten is right next to the hospital. It's like a tennis court. He's like a fool.
I don't know how to explain it.
Wow. There are a couple of them.
Yeah, you're right. Thank you. Thank you. It's like a dog in a room. And you guys are having a party. And you're having a party. And the dog will bite your hair.
It's fun to play with. And in the end, there's no sense of humor at all. It's like... This kid... I don't know what to say. He has a lot of different types. He's fun to play with. He's cute. You'll like him. Yeah, he's a puppy. Yeah, but he's a little... I don't like it. He'll have someone to play with him. And he has different kinds of kids. I don't know what to say. He's a little...
Thank you very much. It's been a long time since I've been here. But I think it's been a long time since I've been here. It's been a long time since I've been here.
I've never been here before. I've never been here.
I've never been here before. I've never been here. And if you have any questions, he will help you solve them.
That's good. Then you can ask him.
I don't know what to say.
This is very popular.
Do you want one? I only want one. Then give it to me. Give it to him. I can't. Then give it to me. I'll give it to you. There's a kind of relationship. You want to talk to me, right? You can talk to me. I can't talk to you. I want to hug you.
You can't talk to me.
Thank you, thank you, thank you. That's a good idea.
You're welcome. Thank you very much. I don't know how to say it in Chinese, but I don't know how to say it in Japanese.
I don't know how to say it in Japanese, but I don't know how to say it in Chinese, but I don't know how to say it in Japanese, but I don't know how to say it in Chinese, but I don't know how to say it in Japanese, but I don't know how to say it in Chinese, but I don't know how to say it in Chinese, but I don't know how to say, Yeah. Yeah.
I don't think so. But I think they're different now. If you want to do something like that, you have to do something like that.
I don't know what you're talking about. Oh, I see. She has a lot of feelings.
I feel the same way. One time, one of his friends, the girl, she was very active, very playful, and the boy couldn't speak at all. He was very sad, but one of his friends said that he thought the boy was very pitiful. He thought that the boy couldn't speak at all. He thought that the boy was very pitiful. He thought that the boy couldn't speak at all. I don't know.
Thank you. I don't know what to say.
I don't know. We were here like a month ago, and we still haven't eaten yet.
Right? Last time we were here. We were here like a month ago, and we still haven't eaten yet.
I want to talk to you first. Okay, that's good. Let's celebrate first. Let's celebrate our new shoes. New shoes. Oh, you're so good at this. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it.
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you. Thank you.
This is their sub-serve.
We seem to be too hungry. No, I want to eat. Ha ha ha. And then you have to do that.
So we need to get the point stuff or we forgot about it.
We also need a box to go. And we can also get a coin for the machine number, right? Wow.
You have to be stable, you have to face it. Boys don't know how to face it, they don't know how to do it. I think this is good. If you press the meat, you can do it. If you press the meat, you can do it.
I'm begging you, I'm begging.
you're back! it's not over yet! I'm back, I'm back! And I don't even know how to speak it. I don't even know how to speak it.
I don't know what to do with it, but I think it's going to be a lot of money. They're going to have to make a lot of money. I don't know what to do with it, but I think it's going to be a lot of money.
I have a question. Sure. There's four of us. Check on the record.
Thank you.
Oh.
I'm sorry, we can't do that. We can't do that.
Sorry. I don't know what you're talking about.
Oh my god.
I don't know how much.
Oh. You.
How do we do it?
Do you want to try it? No, I don't want to try it.
Thank you very much.
I don't know what you're talking about. I don't know.
Cocoa tea.
I was wondering what kind of card I found this time. I also found an Apple Pencil. Do you know this place, bro? Over there. We're over there.
Bye-bye! I'm so happy. You also bought it this month. One year. One year? Oh my god.
I remember last year you said you went to see the cars. Time flies. Not long after we bought the car, we went to see the aurora. We went to see the aurora together. We went to see the car before. Where did we go when he bought the car? We went to a family dinner. And I didn't dare to drive. I didn't dare to drive that day. Because I rented a BMW X5 and X3. Where did we go for dinner? I forgot. We went to a family dinner. Oh, right. With Suyu.
Tesla renewed your bike. I'm going to renew my bike this year. I don't know how much it is. Why is Renewal so expensive? It's really expensive in Australia. What is he doing? He just gave you a sticker. That's it. He doesn't check it for you. Renewal is every year. Yes, yes. It's similar to the age. He doesn't check it. He doesn't check it. It's just that you apply for it last night. It's just that you apply for it last night.
If you want to drive on the road, you'll need this. Or else they'll give you a fine, right? But our car hasn't had a radio for a year. It's okay. Really? Really. You forgot. No, no. I forgot before. But I found out later. It's okay. I was so nervous today. Because I was afraid he'd give me a fine later. I said it's been two days. I've never been given a fine. But I'm going to have a radio this year.
Oh. On the 12th, I was going to renew my contract, but on the 12th, until the 12th of May, he said, maybe the day after tomorrow, he said, if I renewed it last week, until the 7th, which is this year's 12th of May, I'm going to pass the 12th of May. Oh, so he doesn't have a record of when you renewed or didn't renew, right? But if you think about it, as long as I'm not involved in any fights with the police, you're not on the road, you're not on the road, I'm not on the road.
I'm not on the road, I'm not on the road, I'm not on the road. I can't ask him because he's too kind. He's a little better. I think he's a little better. I just feel like Chen Hao is more... Because Mu Qing told me that Chen Hao doesn't ask him, whether he loves him or not. I feel like it's a way for a boy to get along with a girl. It's a way for a girl to get along with a boy. I'm thinking about how to do it when most boys face this problem. Yes.
I think it's pretty fun. It's hard to connect Chen Hao and a little boy together. Yes. Have you heard of the big spring? Yes. Is it here? Yes, it's here. You can stop here. Beautiful. Thank you, uncle. You're welcome. I had a great time today. Bye bye. I hope you guys can solve this problem. Bye bye.
I'm going to eat hot pot with my parents tonight. I'm going home now.
Thank you.
Give me cock, give me Torrico No reason, I can only walk around the house every day The end of the phone call is not an excuse I heard the radio and found out that it was so-go But I just want to lie in the bed of my heart Like I've never opened it before The sky is full of stars, Just waiting for the outside So please let me go I can't let you go.

This is the key me talking me talking me Torrico. Oh, yo. So maybe she knew yo, she's just like that.
I don't know. She died. I don't know. I don't you got it. Well, no, I'm just trying to get like I'm channeling, What do you think? So You can look at. Oh, oh.
oh, oh, oh,
I don't know.
又过了一关, 病都没了还想去学外. 跟面子无关. 偷袭下去就不能吃到一半, 心在挑战着 我坐在网络上看着, 别再承认收拾行李 赶快搭上我班车 有事情我找着 新手包可以丢了. 等你开好房间就邀请我加入一起.
在每个门永远和. 怎么办.
我好想找到灵魂的另一半. 就像Batman和小丑. 等不了队友也是最强的对手 看来能行要找到, What a picture.
The little princess is sleeping in the shed. Don't sleep. Get up. You're so sleepy. Get up. If you keep sleeping, you won't be able to get out of here in 10 minutes. It's okay. It's just a cat. Get up. Yue'er. I just woke up. I just want to sleep. Yue'er. I'm calling Yue'er. Yue'er. Yue'er. Yue'er.
Are you happy? Yes, I'm very happy. Aunt Wang cooked a lot of food for us. We'll come over to eat later. The grilled fish you guys ate was pretty good. The grilled fish was pretty good. I mean, yeah.
It's not cold. It's not cold when you plug it in. Otherwise, it's a bit cold. Youkou, you're so tired. You can rest if you're tired. I'm fine, mom. I'll feed you if you eat well. I'm fine, I'm fine.
Youkou, you're so tired. She wants to eat. Go and feed her. She wants to eat. You can eat well when you're done. Okay, mom? I'm fine, mom. I'll feed you if you eat well. I'm fine, mom. I'll feed you if you eat well.
王乙是坏的. 我说她男朋友是纽约的人. 不说她男朋友可贵呢, I don't know. I don't know why I didn't do anything.
She left. She just knew that she passed away today. When did she pass away? Yesterday. What kind of illness is it? Maybe it's a psychological illness. It's not an illness. Maybe she passed away. Anyway, I don't know. I was going to ask them. I'm going to Alaska in July. I want to ask them if they can help me. I want to tell them in advance. I said I could give them money. For example, give them 20 yuan a day. They live in my house.
Then they told me about this. Oh, you're going to Alaska. When are you going to Alaska? July. Who are you going with? Lin Zi and Mu Qing. Oh, go. But that, that. Yeah, it's that one.
Oh, then you can keep it with a cat. I'll take a look. Maybe I can put it in Linzi's house. Who's watching Linzi's house? Wang Jinxing doesn't go. Oh, yeah, or you can put it in Minjun's house. It's okay for Minjun's family to have a cat. It's good for your child.
The two cats are a bit... It's okay, you can get it done. I feel like it's quite sudden. Yes, Lin Zi Jia's husband is taking care of the whole cat.
How can his dog be taken care of at the same time? Yoho is a good dog. Anyway, one dog and one cat are stronger than two cats. Because two cats hate each other. One dog and one cat means that the dog likes the cat and the cat hates the dog. It's okay, because the dog likes the cat more. But two cats hate each other. That's why two cats are the most difficult to get along with. One cat and one dog are okay, but the dog doesn't care.
The dog doesn't care how the cat beats the dog. The dog can't play with the cat. But the two cats are like two little girls. They have bad moods. No one can stop them. It's okay if they get along with each other. Didn't the children in the Philippines say that your boyfriend is a weirdo? And then you just left without saying anything, right? Yes, I just left without saying anything, and then today I found out that her boyfriend had an accident.
That's so mean. American, right? I've seen her boyfriend once or twice before. I forgot. I've seen her. American. I thought they were all pretty good. You say people are really... I can't see anything. What? I can't see anything even if my boyfriend is sick. Psychological diseases are all difficult to see.
Many people's psychological diseases are their own psychological problems. And then it's hard to see it from other people's point of view. Then this girl went to New York, right? She didn't go. I think I heard the news. Oh, I have to go and see it today. I don't know what to do. I feel like the two of them have been together for a long time. Like family. I was thinking, I was thinking at first.
Is the boy really, maybe it's true. Uh, uh, he's sick. I don't think so. And then you go back to that. I went back to New York, right? And then, and.
中国人这边心理问题还挺严重的,其实你没发现越发达的国家,这地方大家心理问题越严重。 嗯,竞争就太激烈了。往往就贫困山区的那些人,吃饱了喝足了,知足感还挺强的,还挺好的。 它不是竞争激烈,就没啥事做,它不是说每天给你安排好事,早朝九晚五,让你不想别的。你每天都有各种各样的事需要想。
你看那小猫,这猫跑这顶了,这猫跑这顶,看着我的猫了吗? 你他妈,月月,记不记得我啊月月,妈家养的油光水滑的,大月月。 谁跑这顶了呢?王姨都不要上床了,因为她在外边分地捕了,那小黑猫也是,正在分地捕了,晚上上床。 那你现在都不能抱了。 Oh my god, Yueyue. Yueyue is not clean anymore.
Yes, it's buried. When I touched it, it was nine years old. I didn't want to touch it. Hurry up and wash your hands. Yueyue, you are clean. Your signal is not good. You don't even move your head. I didn't move my head. Is the signal bad? Is it moving now? No, I don't have anything. But your signal is not good.
Your signal is not good. I don't know, my legs hurt so much. Where?
Did you get hurt when you were playing in the park? I don't know. How do you feel the pain in your body? I can't feel it. But I can feel it now. I can feel the pain in my body. I have to be 40 years old to feel it. I didn't feel it when I was young. It hurts more and more. Can you feel it now? It hurts more and more.
Bye-bye.
Thank you.
I don't need your money. Who are you applying for? What? I'm going to Taiwan. You've been staying here for more than 10 years. You're not improving. It's your fault. You're only a few million people.
I'm back.
You can't do the challenge. Round one. Eat.
I'm just eating. No, you haven't eaten yet. Then should I say this word? No. What did I say? Think about it. I'm not eating? No. I know. I'm also answering the question. No. I'm answering the question, right? Right. Why did you say it?
I can't do that.
Yep.
Thank you.
Bye-bye.

Your Task:
Step 1: Transcript Segmentation and Context Identification
Carefully read the provided transcript. Divide it into distinct, meaningful events or episodes. Identify context shifts based on:
- Changes in topic
- Changes in location (if inferable from audio cues or explicit mentions)
- Changes in people Wei is interacting with
- Significant time gaps or clear transitions in activity
Each event should represent a cohesive block of activity or interaction.

Step 2: Structured Event Analysis (JSON Output)
For each individual event identified in Step 1, generate a structured analysis in JSON format. The output should be a JSON array of event objects with the following structure:
[
  {
    "event_id": "unique_event_identifier_001",
    "event_title": "A concise summary of what happened",
    "time_range": "Approximate start and end time (e.g., '07:00-07:30')",
    "duration_minutes": 30,
    "mood_labels": ["primary_mood", "secondary_mood"],
    "mood_score": 7,
    "stress_level": 3,
    "energy_level": 8,
    "activity_type": "work|exercise|social|learning|self-care|chores|commute|meal|leisure",
    "people_involved": ["Name1", "Name2"],
    "interaction_dynamic": "collaborative|supportive|tense|neutral|instructional",
    "inferred_impact_on_wei": "energizing|draining|neutral",
    "topic_labels": ["primary_topic", "secondary_topic"],
    "context_summary": "Brief description of what was happening",
    "key_quote_or_moment": "A relevant quote or significant moment"
  }
]

Step 3: Daily Summaries and Visualization Data
Based on the JSON data generated in Step 2, provide:

Overall Daily Scores:
- Daily Mood Score: Calculate a duration-weighted average of mood_score
- Daily Stress Level Score: Calculate a duration-weighted average of stress_level
- Daily Energy Level Score: Calculate a duration-weighted average of energy_level

Energy Level Timeline:
- Provide as an array of [timestamp, energy_level] pairs

Mood Distribution:
- For each primary mood_label, calculate total duration_minutes

Awake Time Allocation:
- Calculate total duration_minutes for each activity_type

Social Interaction Summary:
- For each unique person:
  - Total interaction time
  - Overall inferred impact
  - Key observation about interaction

Topic Analysis:
- List topics with frequency and duration
