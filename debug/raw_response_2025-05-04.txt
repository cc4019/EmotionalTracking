Input Transcript:

=== Consultation Meeting AI Meeting Tools Wine Tasting and Workplace Dynamics ===

This is another recording device that Weiwei recommended. I'm going to start recording now. I'll see how it works later. But I don't know if I'll keep holding it. This is so convenient. It's so small. This is a card. Insert it into this. It's not a bag. Because I think the bag will always feel suspicious. But I later thought that this was still secretly recorded. You can't secretly record when you do this. There is a moral principle. But I think we can record it. Then you can feel the appearance of her samurais. At that time, Weiwei sent the entire recording transcript to AI.
Then I suddenly said, You continue to talk about your South American makeup. I want to see. I also bought one. You bought one? No, I didn't buy this one. I bought Limitless. Yes, another one. OK, I'm looking forward to it. Look, I'm recording today. Weiwei recommended an AI recording software to me. Then what can I do? You can also use the transcript. Then why do you want to record? It's... It's very fun. But you have to do it in Chinese. Oh, it can be connected to your phone, right?
Yes, it can be connected to here. This is a card. I don't know if I can put it here. But why did you buy this? I bought this because I want to see its AI translation function. Take this down. This is an iron ring. It can be connected to your phone. Oh, my notebook. She brought it herself. Oh, that's right. Yes, that's right. Why? Didn't you bring your phone with you? Yes, I did. Yes, that's right.
I'll stay here. Friends.
Everyone interested in doing a tasting today? So if you are not interested, so we are not doing it? Yes, you don't have to do one. So I saw that there were four reservations that were paid for. But I was just wondering if everyone was interested in doing a tasting.
You can order by glass.
Oh yeah, you can do some glasses too. I will watch every one. It would be great when they are tipsy. Yes, there you go. There you go. Okay, so I'll bring out just bubbles for everybody and I'll come back and see what we're looking at. This is going to be our featured flight for the month. And then there is a more expensive flight by $20 of some kind of higher priced bottles that you could do as well. So, up to you. Thank you. I'll bring out bubbles for everybody. Just to get us settled in. Thank you.
This is for everyone. What are the bubbles for? Sparkling wine.
Complimentary? Flags.
So, we are each. Oh, I thought it was the texture of the alcohol.
I can protect you. Like this. Let's go together. One is about this much. It's really fun. It's super successful. I've been thinking about it. I'm going to try it first. Maybe I'll try it again. Maybe I'll try it again.
. . . . Yeah, I think it will have a planned time to listen to Holocaust.
It's very important. You have to allocate time to do things that you think can improve your skills. Allocating time is very important to an NPC. So sometimes there are things that force you to allocate time to do things that you think can improve your skills. I think NPCs need to be smartly structured. It's hard for us to do things by ourselves. For example, when I want to study something, I have to find someone else to do it. Because I have a very poor understanding of myself.
I don't know. It's hard to tell if you're in the left or in the right. Some people say you can only jump once. But I thought it was easy. She didn't say you can only jump once. She said she liked it. Slowly, slowly, slowly. Do you think it will affect you? Yes, I think I will be affected. Maybe I'm still a kid. But sometimes when I'm in danger, or when I feel stable, or when I'm in a hurry, I'll be like this. Yes, I can do anything. Yes, I think it's amazing. But by default, why do I think it's by default? We're both by default. We're both kids.
I found another one from Coco Sanger. It's a Chinese one. It's a featured one. But I said I would partner with them. I'll let you guys sit on this and look over the menu a little bit longer.
Thank you. What is this one? This is just our standard brew. So it's made in the traditional Champagne style. But we can't call anything outside of Champagne, Champagne. But it has all these ingredients. So it's made in the Champagne style. Thank you. Do you want to say something to Shuyu. 
I want to say something, too. I just left. Thank you. New chapter. Thank you. Everyone is a new chapter. Let's celebrate. I'm so happy. Shuyu, what do you want to do? Do you have any plans for what you want to do next? I have some ideas. But... Where are you going? I'm going back to Europe for a week. I'll stay in China for a month and come back. That's great! So you got the card right away? No.
Combo car. Combo car, oh. Sorry, sorry, I got distracted. Sorry, sorry, I got distracted too. Temporary.
Yeah, that's right. And your strategy is really good. Don't ask for permission, ask for forgiveness. Yes, ask for forgiveness. This is really good. It's really good. Where should I put my phone? Choose a flight. She wrote something really good. Choose two white ones. Or you can choose four white ones. But we want two. I don't understand Chinese. You don't understand Chinese? I don't understand either. This one is more refreshing.
It's more sweet. It's not dry. I like this one better. I think this one is really soft. It's really good. What do we have here? Everyone, who has a taste for wine? I think women have a taste for wine the most. Who do you want? But we like expensive ones. Yes, that's right.
We can choose 4 out of 8. We can choose the color we want. We can choose the color we want.
What? How many of us are in the group? What are you talking about? It's perfect. But I already posted that one. What are you looking at? But I already posted that one. Who posted that one? No, no, no. I posted this one. There are quite a lot. This one is actually like... This is related to me and Cheng Hao.
I can't remember how many times I felt it. And then he gave me a He told me, he said, have you seen it? Let me ask you, what do you think about it? He said he didn't like it, he said he didn't like it. Inspiration, he participated. Thank you. I also sent it. We sent it last week.
Oh my god.
Do I have to put it in here? Yes, I think so. Mingjun, did you choose? Would anyone like to do a flight? Yes. Who would like to do a flight? Can we just have two of these and two of these? We'll just share. That's fantastic. You guys have one feature. Actually one feature. And then we can also pick one. Two of a reserve. And one makes a hash. And we are working on the, Yes, in one mix-and-match. Okay, sounds good. I can fill them all in the little, and just bring them over all at once if you want. So you can see everything. Okay, sounds good. Perfect. So I can take that mix-and-match. Oh, we have a... Oh, we have a mix-and-match. We have a mix-and-match. We have a mix-and-match.
But the other ones are going to be dry. The other ones, all of the whites and the unrized are all going to be dry. Have you seen your mother's painting? Oh, she's really kind.
I often talk to people and they're like, Oh, yeah. I don't know what to say. I feel like... I'm filled with love. Thank you. I feel happy. Thank you. You can open it at any time. Your gift? Do you have mine? I'm going to start a new group. I'm not afraid. How can I not be afraid? Thank you. This is for you. Thank you. So cute.
This is a present. We've been talking about presents for a long time. I'll show you a present.
This is a gift. I bought this as a child. Wow. It's amazing.
Is this a flashlight? So cute. Do you have a pair of scissors? No. What about me? I like this color. Thank you. You look good with this color. No, I have a big head. I refuse to wear a hat. I want a present, too. Youko has a lot of presents.
You don't need anything. You don't need anything. You don't need anything.
You'd better mark it, you can't do it. Tell me.
I want to see what kind of seed it is. I like this one. I think it's like...
It feels like a small flower. Full of stars.
You said that. 
Wow. Wow. Wow. What do you want to give me next time? Do I have a birthday. 
It's too late, it was supposed to be a good time for a test.
Linzi, I bought that EMS Hollywood lounge chair. What kind of thing is that? Which lounge chair? And I also have her EMS Hollywood lounge chair. How much did you spend? You're rich. No, no. And I also have that... What kind of... Let me show you the picture. That's one of my dreams. Have you had a discount recently, or why did you suddenly decide to buy it? I've had a discount recently. How much is the EMS Hollywood lounge chair? 75 yuan. Where is the EMS Hollywood lounge chair?
What kind of chair is that? Is it the one you have upstairs? No, it's not that one. It's the wooden one. I know, I know. Let me see. I saw it for the first time. I'm going to make a chair at Ming Jun's house. I don't think I've ever had that kind of feeling before. Let's go to the archive.
What's wrong?
Is this the only color in the office? There are other colors. I think this one looks good.
It looks good, right? When you sit on it, do you feel like you're sitting on a flower? I feel like I'm sitting on the front. I feel like I'm sitting on the board. I haven't sat on it yet. This one is clear.
I feel like I'm sitting on a flower. When I saw it from a distance, I thought it was a dress. But it's actually a dress. The color is a bit similar. What color is the color of your school? Purple. Purple is good. Look at the current price. From 1,000 yuan to 4,000 yuan. But it's actually hard to do. I think it's hard to do it with a curve. It's hard to do it with a curve. It looks good. I also cut the shipping fee.
I also told them to cut the shipping fee. Because I'm a designer. I know how to cut it. Because every time I go to the airport. I think you two look more and more like each other. From this angle, I think your eyes are very similar. It's the nose and mouth are very similar. Really? But I look better, right? Of course. The way you two laugh is the same.
And I marked.
Then with the little light that it is right here. So this is the picture.
Whoa! Aww.
Did you see how much this cup is? Why is it so much more than this one? I just drank it. It's okay, you didn't film it just now. We won't block it. Linzi, do you guys have a...
This is the list of adventures.
Yeah. Adventure list.
Wishlist.
Let me try it. It's a one-month stay. One-month stay? Yes, it's a one-month stay.
He must be very suitable for this kind of practice. Yes, because he can do remote work. It's so helpful. Yes, yes, yes.
Maybe in September. I don't know yet. Because he is expected to start training in August. But you have to work. Because we have a team in Australia. I don't know when he will start training. Maybe in two or three hours. I don't know yet.
He is just comfortable.
It's so helpful. I also want to start working. You just changed. You will change next week. I will change next week. I will change again. But sometimes I feel like it's too much. If you give me a lot of freedom, for example, I don't know when I can go to work every day, I will feel very uncomfortable. This is what I found out recently. Do you think ADHD needs a schedule? I think so. Yes, it needs a schedule. Yes, if it's every day, for example, the new group now, everyone is from nine to ten,
from five to six in the afternoon, you seem to be very busy. But maybe for my new mental health, it's a good thing. Yes. Now I can go to the office every afternoon at one o'clock. But when I get up in the morning, I don't have any motivation. Then I feel like I just found out recently. Because I used to think I hope to have a lot of freedom. I hope to be able to sleep naturally every day. Then I do a very flexible thing. But recently I found that it's not very good for mental health. It will be more and more depressed. So I read a book yesterday. How to Focus. Then I thought of you. Me too.
For example, Tell him. For example, No, I didn't read it. You didn't read the content. Thank you.
He saw a book. Yes, I saw it. I saw a book.
I think you are more suitable for three days, two days, one week, two days, or three days in the office. Or five days. Five days, do you feel tired now? It's okay, I can't do it until one o'clock in the afternoon. I just want to do it until one o'clock in the afternoon. But let me see the new group. Let's try it first. Do you think the process of discovering yourself is very interesting? Although I'm fully remote right now, I'm still focused on my office. But we don't have a lot of people in our office. If you were to come out for a drink, would you tell Mark to come out for a drink today? No, I wouldn't. I wouldn't. I don't even know him. I wouldn't. If I were to do it, I would do it. It would be very comfortable.
That's the best. Because if you come to my house, I can't mark it. You can't mark it. I can't either. I often miss my friends. So I've been wondering why you're ADHD. Because ADHD...
I often miss appointments, but you never do. No, I have obsessive-compulsive disorder. If I miss it, I'll go crazy. You might be OCD. Everyone has been diagnosed. I'm not. No, I was just discussing with you. Come on, come on, come on. Do you want to take a picture? I think this is pretty good. I think this is good.
Should we? Should we? I don't know.
Okay, that'll get everybody in, perfect, three, two, one.
Thank you.
Oh, yeah yeah yeah.
This is really sweet. You can take the first one. What else? This one is RISD. But not all of them are the same. Not all of them are the same? Only two of them are the same. Look at the order. I don't know which one you chose. Take one. I chose a 2019 one. Then the third one is this one. This one. Try it.
Do you drink this much? It's Lysine. This one is a little bigger. I don't dare to drink it. I've been driving a car for a long time. Do you want to use the one that doesn't stick? This one is very refreshing. Do you want to try it? This one has almost no alcohol in it. It's dry. I want to try that one.
It's so pretty. It's like the color of Rosé. Is it made like this? It's made with the skin of a grape. Rosé is made with the skin of a grape. The skin of a grape. The skin of a red grape. This one is very refreshing. This one is very light.
Hey, we're done drinking. The color is so different. The color is like... Oh, it's like a high-class feeling. Like a high-class feeling. Like a crystal. Yellow crystal. And this one is deeper. Try it. It's a new wine. Try it. You try it. I... It's really good.
Let's put it in the glass. Let's take these two. This one is so refreshing. It's as light as water. Let's try it. Cheers. I started to drink more wine instead of cocktails. Because last time we also...
The reason why we have a wine tasting is because I told Linzi last week that we went to a small bar in Ballardy that sells natural wine. And there was a wine... Oh, you ordered it. You go. You said it was so natural. This is a natural wine bar. It's white. We had a few glasses of wine. And there was a bottle of white wine.
It's white wine. But it's been brewed for a while. So it's pink. But it's not red wine. Oh, it's like oxidized wine. Yeah, it's like between a white wine and a red wine. It's very strange. And it tastes like honey.
I think it's good. That's also a wine bar. It's a wine bar.
I thought it was rosé. I thought it was rosé. Rosé has a time limit. You need enough time to order rosé. If it's sweet, the time limit is short. Chai tea. It should be a sweet wine. Come on, tell us. Tell me. What is rosé? Oh, the one you sent me. Oh, right. You should know. You've been in France for a long time. I don't know what brand this is. This is the brand. This is the brand.
Yeah, it's a kind of talisman. And it's white as well. Yes. It's really bright and bright white wine. This is it. Yes, look at the color. It's a bit pale. Yes, it's the same as this one. It's the same as this one. It feels like the white wine I've tried before. I'm hungry. Me too. I'm thinking about finding a good Chinese restaurant. This one is good too.
It's salty. Salty? It's always salty. But I think it's good. Do you like ice wine? I've tried it before.
Right. I just finished drinking. What do you think? This is... It's not expensive. It's a bit expensive. This is a bit expensive. It's a bit expensive. It's a bit expensive. What do you think? Handsome, friendly. We should prepare at the same time. So we can understand each other. Actually, there is a overlap. That set is the same as this set. I don't know if there is a small book. We can write it on the board. What do you think it is? Then we can write it together. See what people think.
What are you thinking about. 
This is so much fun. 
You can play with it. Actually, you can take one and we can solve it. Do you want to use alcohol? And there's a pen. We can just have a sip. I like to play. How do you stick it on your head? Do you see this?
Who's going to write it? You can write it down. Can you write it down? Yes. Then we'll write down the names. She'll write down our names. Okay. Then you can write down everyone's names. I'll write down everyone's names. I don't think... Everyone will write down one. Just two people. One by one.
I really don't know what people are watching right now. Hey, did anyone watch Black Mirror recently? I watched it. Did you like it? No, I watched two episodes. I have one. I like this one. That episode is the first one. I think it's pretty good. You're the seventh one, right? I don't remember. I saw it when I was dancing.
Let's take a picture together. Let me show you a little trick. I'm really embarrassed. I'm at the garage door. My phone is out of battery. I got out of the car when I got out of the car. Then I was in the trunk of the trunk. Then I got in the car. I can't open the car. I'm stuck there. I'll take some empty glasses out of the way.
That would be great. I'm stuck.
He's licking your hand? No, he's licking his own hand. I was playing with him, and he kept hitting the tortoise. When he got the tortoise, he hit the tortoise really badly.
The tortoise was like Kirby's tortoise.
He hid behind the board of our boat. He's so happy. He's always happy. What's he doing? He's hiding behind the board of our boat. His eyes look like his eyes.
She's still in the back. Yeah. She's still in the back.
What kind of store is this? I saw it too. Where is it? It's near here. There's a resort nearby. There's a place nearby. There's a place nearby.
What sauce do you have in the middle? Which one do you want to eat? This one, the second one, the third one, which one? That one is potato. I want the first one, the sausage. I want the first one. Thank you.
Your name is... You have to drink it after you say ha-ha-ha. This is good. How can you choose your own? We want to give you a ha-ha-ha. This is yours. You can't look at it. You can't look at it for a while. I want a white one. Just a white one. I want a white one. I want a white one.

You're so transparent. Let me see. Can I look like this? You guys can start. I can't see. You can't look at it yourself. You look like this. You look like a French woman.
Like this. I think it's okay. I'm a little embarrassed. I thought I gave it to you.
Is it real. 
It's real. We have a few limited ones. You can give them to everyone. You don't have it. I want a white one. You're a French. I'll help you. I'm sorry. I'll help you with the tape.
I didn't see myself. Can you see it. 
Who are they? Oh, okay. Let me see, let me see, let me see. Uh, uh, that's the host. You two. I'm sure I know what you're going to write. Okay, okay. How is it? I don't know. Uh, wait a minute. I forgot. Oh, oh, oh. What are you? What are you? Show me. Oh. Get the call.
I want a white cheese.

No, I'm not dizzy. I usually talk a lot when I'm done drinking. Don't cry. I'll wait for you. How have you been lately? I'm happy. Cheers.
Whose face do you think is the reddest? The one whose nose is red. Oh, that's not right. Oh, she's pouring me some water. It's so hard. Thank you. I don't think it's hard. It's probably because... It's probably because... That's right! How did you guess it? I didn't guess it. You held on to it for so long. I didn't guess it either. Who do you think will win? The three of you, who do you think will win? The three of you,
Ha ha. It's not completely true. It's not completely true.
Very close. We said you should drink again today. What kind of action do you think you're doing now? What kind of action do you think you're doing now? Is it good? I don't know.
Minjun just said that he should drink a few times. Let's let him drink water for his driving safety. Let him guess. How do you guess? Guess. Oh, it's time to drink again. What kind of trick is this? Can't you use your words? It's okay to talk. I'm used to it. I'm used to it.
Who do you think is the most popular? You're a man. Whose man? That little girl's man.
I want to buy a bottle of wine. Really? Yes. You wrote this? Yes. But I really want to know you now.
I really want to know you. I really want to know what this is. Yes, tell me. Yes. But you guess first. I won't tell you. You guess first. He really wants to know what this is. What's wrong? What happened? Nothing. The two of you are poisoned. Who wants to drink? The two of us have the same disease. But the two of us have the same disease.
The two of us have the same disease. I want to stand like this. How about this? You stand up.
No, I know it's a sign. No, no, no. It's almost the same. No, it's not.
What is this cheese? I don't know. What about Minjun? Minjun has already eaten a lot. This side is... So this is a restaurant. So you two can be champions. I don't think I can guess. Who? You and... You two can seduce each other. Yes, yes, yes. That's what it means. Yes. Who is the last one. 
Come on.
Sometimes you have to define yourself. For example, I often see him as the most... What do you mean? I mean, I agree with a certain person's point of view. I agree.
Drink.
Tao Zeyuan, it's his turn. I think sometimes I'm influenced by subconsciousness. Really. 
We were just like this. We were both like this. You let her clap her hands. Drink. You should drink. There was a moment when we were like this.
There was no smile. And then she... Clap your hands. No. If I were to talk about you, you would have drunk a lot earlier. Yes. You two are a bit special. Yes, we are very special. But actually, you are good at this. You have done a lot of things for yourself. But the most important thing is that he has done this a lot of times. It's all on an important person. What? Is there? Yes. How did you know it was floating. 
Did you guess it. 
No. Then why did you leave? Reset. He went to buy a bottle of wine. I thought I was going to buy a bottle of wine. No, he's the last one.
I think it's okay anyway. Hang in there until the end.
Who do you like to drink? I like to drink. Drink.
I don't even know how to drink. It's over. You drink it.
Your hands are very good. I think so. I think so, too. No. We have mastered the game together. I think Xiao Hong's is the easiest one. This one is pretty good. If you put this on someone else, it basically doesn't work. So you know that Min Jun has always been... I'm leaving. I'll come back later and flip it over. Min Jun's is so cute. I didn't say a word to Xiao Hong.
Between you two, who drinks first? Between you two, who drinks first? Some of them are easy to understand, but some are hard to understand.
It's a subconscious action.
I have something to say. What do you think? Between you and Wang Jingxing. 
whose glasses are more beautiful? Wrong. Between you and Wang Jingxing, whose glasses are more beautiful? Well, you see... Between you and Mu Qing, whose eyes are bigger? Whose hair is bigger? Your hair is bigger.
What are the differences.
between your clothes today? Between you two.
The difference is that I have to grab my clothes.
in the shortest time. What do you think matches your clothes. 
Which one do you think is the best? I haven't tried this one yet.
Which one do you like the most? Which one do you like the most? Oh, yes, he's very talented.
So who do you think we are? Bless you, bless you, bless you. Xiaomong is laughing She answered by herself.
Q me, Who do you hate the most? Who do you hate the most in the world? Bless you, You are so mean I like you I think Lin Zi has a few.
Lin Zi has a few? I think she is pretty What's wrong with Xiaomong. 
What's wrong with Lin Zi? She went to buy She went to buy wine, What does dry mean? Dry. It's not smooth. But do you think it's dry or smooth? It's in the middle. I used to like it more. Smooth. I used to like it more. As I get older, I can start to appreciate a little bit of dryness. The red grape is relatively dry.
It's also sweet.
It's sweet. The red grape is not very thick. You will feel its texture. I think this table has been studied by many people.
It's been studied by many people.
Which one is more expensive? No. It depends on the wine. You like the expensive one. I like the expensive one. The cheaper, the better. Which one do you think is better. 
The cheaper one. I think if I didn't drink, I would be in trouble again. If I drank too much, I would be in trouble again. Why? I don't know if it's a serious problem or a... Then guess what we want you to do. I don't know.
Hello. Wow.
You won. You won.
I'm a little more messy.
We don't have that... What are you talking about? Don't say messy. Your prongs are messy. I know what you're talking about. I'm thinking about it. You're thinking about it? You know.
Don't be afraid to drink at the beginning. Keep doing all kinds of things. We're learning. So what's your assumption now? My assumption is that it's someone else. When did you realize it? I have a feeling. It's because of all your movements. I think it's hard to guess the movements. Minjun hasn't figured it out yet. He's been struggling for a long time.
Yes, it's totally you. She's good at observing. I don't even know how to touch my nose. You really like touching your nose. She also likes to flip her phone. You like touching your nose too. You know how to touch your hair. I think she's trying her best not to touch her nose. It's messy. Junjun is back. Junjun, are you back in a dizzy state? Or... Where are you going? I'm buying two bottles of wine. I'm looking at the wine. Are you going to buy wine?
I haven't bought it yet. I'm just looking at it. Do you know what you're doing. 
I know I'm buying two bottles of wine.
No, no. I'm talking about when you drink wine. Can you drive later? Her face is so red. Let's have dinner first. I'll drive her there and come back to pick her up. We'll have dinner nearby. I'm just looking at the wine. I can't figure it out. You're too close.
It's all about the movement. You can't move. You can't do that. I can't use my hand to pick something up. Didn't I just say that your hands are not clean?
Your ring is pretty. It's fine. I can't believe it's all gone. It's all gone now. I can't drink with my hands up.
You can. Do you think this game makes you feel like you're being attacked. 
I'm already crazy. This is a little animal. You're subconscious. Very close. I can't stare at you. Are you in love with me? I can't stare at everyone. No, I'm not that cruel. I can't hold my hand like this. Very close. So close. Like literally a little bit.
I can't hold my hand like this. You're going to kill me.
You have to thank me. It's your turn.
I can't put my hand here. I can't hold my fist. Drink first. You are so kind today. You are so kind. I can't hold my fist. I can't use my right hand to hold this.
It's not that specific. It's not that hard. It's not that specific. It's very obvious. You often do my moves. That's why I wrote it. It's related to your face. Yes. Your face and chin are different.
I can't touch my nose with my hand. Yes. You often touch your nose. Really? Yes. Try to do this. I don't know. Because it's hard for me to touch my chin. Try to do this. You are very observant. Really? Yes. In such a short time. I didn't realize it. Really? Yes. You didn't realize it. Yes. I want to... I want to...
This game is so fun. It's so funny. It's so fun to play alone. Oh, there's also that kind of game. For example, there's a game where all four of us are different from each other. Right, right, right.
Yeah, we can play. Yeah, we can play. I feel like I'm back in college. Wow, I have 276 followers now. Is this sweet? Try it. It's too dry. It's very smooth. How do you do it? How do you adjust it? You just put it on the bottom. But I think it's very slippery. The color is... It's the feeling of the end, not the feeling of the entrance. Because I think the entrance is very slippery. I think the entrance is very slippery. But maybe the background is colored. It's you.
I like white wine the most. I like white wine too. Because white wine is sweet and refreshing. But I think the second one is better.
I have no idea. It doesn't matter. Just remember this game. It's fun to play.
We are having a drink today. There are 8 players in our game.
Do you want to go to this room? Can we share the room? Xiao Hong's nightmare is that she doesn't like to play this kind of game where you have to lose weight. Xiao Hong is like, okay. Here it is.
Who is the spy? You can use your phone now.
Who is the spy? I can go to the game. No, this is another game. Who is the spy? This is another game. You two are really afraid of this game. I'm really afraid of this game. What is your MBTI? INFJ. I think you two have something in common. But Minjun is very shy. He has to be in the middle when he drives.
In the middle of the road. I have to be in the middle of the road. When you drive, I'm very scared. Your comment on the car made me very scared. I'm afraid. Where is the pressure line. 
It's so strict.
It shows that you are very advanced. You can go back and forth between NF and ST. People who are advanced are in the middle. I'll do it.

Jeremy. CCC. CCC. The rule is that each of us has to describe what the word is about. How many questions? Two questions. But I can't... You don't know if you're an undercover or a real person. So you have to control yourself. You can't say too many words. You can't be too vague. Because if you're too vague, people will think you're an undercover. Yeah, and then after a round, everyone has to vote, right? Yeah. Who's an undercover? But I don't know who's an undercover. Yeah, we all know who's an undercover.
I want to know if the words of the undercover people are the same or not. The words of the undercover people are the same or not. The words of the undercover people are the same or not.
You. I'm number 3. Sorry. Say something. I don't like to eat. The two of us don't know how to say it. Who are you? Of course it's me. I'm just a normal person. She doesn't have a name. She's suspicious. Number 5. Number 5 is me. Do you cook or use a knife? I don't know.
Who is number 6? Song Zuyin. Sometimes I have a relationship with him.
Who's number 7? Who's number 7? Number 7. Who's number 7? Who's number 7? Okay, okay. Okay, we can start now, right? Ah, we can start now? Yes. We have to count one person for each round, right? What did you say, Shuyu? I said it's a kind of K-drama. And then what did you say? We can cook. And then what did you say? I said it's a kind of K-drama. And then what did you say? I said it's a kind of K-drama. And then what did you say. 
How many votes did Chen Hao get? I got two votes. I got three votes. Who wants to go first? I want to go first. You stand in front of me. You two stand in front of me. The restaurant is very convenient. You can choose your own restaurant.
Three, two, one.
What? Who? I vote for them two. Oh, them two. I think it's okay to keep the original choice. I'll go first, because there must be four people at the beginning. Okay, then I'll go first. I'll go fourth. Then how do you go down on the fourth. 
Continue to speak on the fifth. You are a civilian. I am a civilian. You are a civilian. You started on the fifth.
I don't know. But I think this is information. In fact, you can't say. If you say I am a civilian, you will know. We can all see it. I hate you. Some people like to eat, some people don't like to eat. Say it again.
Sixth. Little Fox. Little, little, little. It's me. I am Little Fox. Who? Me, me, me. Sixth. Little Fox. Who is Little Fox. 
What did you say? I didn't say anything.
Oh, my mom planted this. Your mom planted this? Number 7. My number 7. Adults are more tolerant than children. And they will cry. Number 8. I'm number 8? Why didn't I say it this time? It's like pouring water. Oh, I see. There are fresh ones and dried ones.
The colors are red and green.
Oh, I'm so surprised. You got the color wrong all of a sudden.
It's my turn. There are many ways to make it. It's supposed to be made from the dried one. I wanted to say it's made from the dried one. I heard that it's made from a very rich ingredient.
Can I have a taste? I haven't said it yet. Why? I haven't said it yet. Who pressed it. 
I didn't press it. No, I don't think so. Okay. Then the chef's identity will be exposed. But I haven't seen it yet. What's the chef's identity? Did you see it? I saw it. Then you can add it again. It's okay. Then who was it just now? It should be the chef. No, I... But it doesn't matter. No, why am I the chef? I don't know. It's not the chef. It's me. Why am I the chef? Oh, it's okay. It's this round. Who did it? It's not good to replace the chef.
Who did it? He's the one who plays the game.
Don't eliminate the chef. Eliminate the one who was pointed at. That's right. Let's start. But we don't know the answer. It's okay.
Yes. Three, two, one. Okay. Then I'll pick you up first. Okay. I'll do it. You don't have to... The chef will continue to play with Wang Jinsi. No. You have to know him. Then I'll pick it up. Pick it up. It's you. I'm Ping Ping. Oh. Okay. The next one starts with me.
No. 2.
No. Then the chef... No. You can keep talking, it doesn't matter. But you can't keep talking. Then I can't talk anymore. Yes, you can't talk anymore. Because what you're saying is... You're a little undercover.
Maybe I'm a little suspicious again.
I think the undercover may also know what it is now, so they are pretending to say something.
Yeah.
So you can't talk about it in detail. Yes, you have to talk. You have to talk. Okay, then it's my turn next. You can also make it into powder. I like to eat. I'm done. Number 6. You can eat it fresh, or eat it dry. It's too fast.
Number 7, me. In a way, it's called an allergic reaction. That's how I feel.
Okay, next.
I'm thinking. I feel like I'm always being too specific. Mexican people often cook with this. Mexican food. Mexican, okay.
Who's next? Are we done? We're done. Okay, then we can start. Who's next? Number 3.
And then there's Meiji, and then there's Muqi, and then there's Muqi and then there's Mu.
You're the only one who said I'm the spy. Then you don't have to say it. Why did you say it? Someone said it. Who said it? I didn't say it.
Then why is there only one spy left? Who is the spy? I saw it. How can there be a spy? Let's do it again. I think it's the spy.
Because you said the spy. Then I realized it. I'm also the spy. I didn't know it. You guessed it. I guessed it.
Most of the words are chili. But I didn't know it. But you said it. Because others said it.
And I didn't say it. I'm suspicious. Someone said it.
No, no, I'm here. Number 3, number 4, number 8.
Are we eating here? We're eating outside. Let's go out and eat. We're going to look around. There's another person. Number 8. I already added it. You can come out and add it. I was here just now. Minjun is here. I'm here. I don't know. I don't think there's a number 8. Who is this little fox? It's me. What's the number 1? The number 1 is not here. I'm going to add it. You're going to add it.
Okay, let's start.
Okay, oh shoot.
Why didn't we start. 
Who started on the 2nd? Who are you? I... I... I... I play that game often. Who's on the 2nd? I'm on the 2nd. Who's on the 1st? 3rd. Why are you on the 5th? I'm on the 3rd. Who's on the 1st? I didn't say who's on the 1st. She started on the 2nd. Then... Then... Then I... Well... I used to play this game often when I was a kid.
It's my turn. This game is quite popular. But I don't understand it. What number do you like? I'm done. It's number 6. Number 5. There are also related movies. I don't know.
Number 7.
I remember you guys went to a similar theme park before. Number 8.
I think number 8 has a different meaning. Number 1. I think it's number 5. It's like going through the past.
Number 3. I think it's number 6.
I have a question. When we were talking about you, we didn't talk about my rationale. Why am I a spy? I don't think so. I don't think so.
Can you tell me how to do that. 
Who's next?
I don't know why someone pressed the bell. Isn't this too obvious. 
Who pressed the bell for me? I didn't press it. Did you choose to press it yourself? I didn't press it. Three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
Then don't press it. Okay, then I'll go first. You guys go first. It's my turn.
Then... It's your turn. There are animals in this game. And then there are characters. Because I don't want to make it... I think everyone made it too obvious. The spy will know. The spy can pretend to say what to say. This game can't be played like that. So you're pretending to be a civilian now, right? The spy can't lie. You can't... Even if you guess it, you have to find a way. Oh, I see, I see. But I can't make myself look like Oji.
Run, run, run. But... Yes. And then? Number nine.
Okay. How many cups did she drink? Oh, number five? No, no, no.
Hi, guys. I'm just taking care of you while Chloe's at lunch. Are we still doing alright here? Yeah, very good. Awesome. Yeah, we might. Do you want to do anything else? Yeah, we might. Just be all around your friends first. Yeah, I think. Of course, yeah. Yeah. Nice.
Do you play this game. 
My game? Yes, your game. This game is the same as Kirby in another game. But in another game, it's a new game. What? Yes. This game is the same as Kirby in other games. But in other games, it's a new game. What about you? Mu Qing Bao Bao. No.7. No.7? Yes.
No.7 is finished. It's a kind of heroism. It's gone. I don't know who is the spy in the end. What did Lin Zi say? She won the game. Let's eat. Okay, let's go now. Do we still need to vote? Let's vote.
3, 2, 1. You didn't vote. The three of us didn't vote. Oh, I see. You guys are super horsepower. You guys are super horsepower, right? I really don't know what that is. I don't know. I just looked it up.
I don't know what super horsepower is.
I don't know what super horsepower is either. We're super horsepower. I thought you guys were super horsepower.
Oh, yes. Super Mario.
I want cream puffs and hot pot. Do you want to eat pizza? I want to eat hot pot. Hot pot... Yes, it's all western food. Hot pot is fine. Which hot pot do you want to eat? Hot pot. I suddenly thought of... I can eat anything.
I want to eat something.
I can eat anything. I drink too.
Who wants to buy wine? I want to buy wine. If this is Nan Da Hua, we can eat vegetables. What kind of wine do you want to buy? Nan Da Hua. It's too far. Where is it? Nandahua Ransom. If you want to buy alcohol, you can order this tasting. There are a lot of delicious things here. But you have to buy a full pack. Is there a Yangguo Hu Maratang here? How much is it? We can buy it together.
Oh, okay. Do you have anything that you want to eat but haven't eaten yet. 
Are you cold, baby. 
You can't touch your legs. Your legs are so cold. It doesn't feel good. Aren't you warm? If I were a lesbian, I wouldn't feel good. I don't think there's a lot of Chinese food here. In Kirkland, right? Yes. There's not much Chinese food in Kirkland. Maybe in Thailand.
What do you want to eat? I want to eat... Because I'm not that hungry. But I want to eat something flavorful. I think it's because this place is very flavorful.
What kind of dim sum do you want to eat? What kind of dim sum? What's wrong? Are you tired? No, I don't eat dim sum in Seattle. I think it's very good in Vancouver.
Have you ever eaten a grilled fish restaurant in Bellevue? What's the name of the restaurant? Zhuge Grilled Fish. Shimeo Dang. 
Shimeo Dang Grilled Fish. Isn't it fresh? Is it fresh. 
They have a Grilled Fish with Nine Brothers. I haven't eaten it. Then you can eat it. I think it's okay. But he said it's a grilled fish. You think... But I'm just a proposal. I don't think it's a grilled fish. What's the name of the grilled fish restaurant we ate last time? Zhuge Grilled Fish. In Bellevue. What's the name of the restaurant in Vancouver? Bellevue.
Isn't it Grilled Fish? And who's that? It's the same.
I don't remember. I haven't tried it. Is it spicy hot pot? It's not spicy. I haven't tried it. Have you tried spicy hot pot? No, I haven't tried it. It's too spicy. I haven't tried it. It's too spicy. I haven't tried it.
It's so good. It's fried fish, right. 
It doesn't have much of an impact on other dishes. It just has an impact on the fish.
We ordered a raw fish with boiled water this morning. It's so good, but it's too spicy. When was it? Was it recently? No, it wasn't recently. It was many years ago. It wasn't many years ago. It was one or two years ago. But I still remember that it was really good. It was a memorable moment. Then we'll go there. It's not that bad. But it's a bit far away.
Let me see. It takes about 20 minutes to get to Baiming. 20 minutes.
Yes, it takes about 20 minutes. It's so beautiful. It's not in Yanggu. Have you eaten coral shrimp recently? I bought coral shrimp at TNT yesterday. Have you eaten it recently? Yes. It's 21 yuan for a pack. Is it good? It's very cheap. It's delicious when steamed. It's super delicious. I want to buy it. I also bought some chrysanthemum. It's really good. How did you cook it? I put it in the hot pot.
You guys go buy it. They want to buy it. It's really good. Let's go. There's a Chinese restaurant in Wanqu. Me and Meimei went there. We went there too. It's so good. The osmanthus is so tender. My new boss has added me to their team twice. I'm so happy.
My new boss is ESCJ. I think it might be between ENTJ and ESTJ. I'm pretty close. My new boss is ESTJ or ENTJ. I think me and Jay know each other. There's an ENFP in the group. You've already guessed everyone's MBTI.
Did you guess it, or did you just guess it? I guessed it. We also have a question. Most of the people have the same answer. Because our group has a kind of... I have a question for you. He doesn't want you to know his MBTI.
He said you would be against him. I don't know if there is such a thought in MBTI. In fact, this mentality also proves that he is not a female MBTI. If there is an ENFP, you must know him.
He is probably an NTP. I'm getting more and more afraid of NTP. ENTP and NTP, I'm very afraid of them. I think STJ is easy to predict. Sometimes you may think he is a little bit stubborn. But I think this is easy to predict. You can communicate with him. You won't have the feeling that all of a sudden he is being played. Or he wants to do things better. I think NTP... What's wrong? Are you a random answer? Yes, I'm a random answer.
For example, Contextual, AI, Siena, and Stamina are the ones that help you to understand your environment. And how you can help to collect those things and apply for UX. Last week, I met a friend from Hong Kong. And next week, I will meet a friend from Saskatchewan. And then we will meet. And then you will meet? Yes. Will you go? I haven't decided yet. Because I want to talk about the treatment.
Yes. Of course, I think Adobe is very different from Meta. Adobe is like swimming in a swimming pool. And everyone is holding you. And it's very warm. And there is no big pressure. Do you know Adobe? Yes. But if you want to fly, you can't fly fast in the water. The whole environment is slow. META is like you're flying in a valley, but if there's wind, then you'll be in trouble. I think META is like you're at the top of the mountain, and you have to fly to get there. Yeah, but when you have good energy, when everything is going well, you can do a lot of interesting things and be free.
And if you have to share any place, for example, the priority of Oregon is not right, the boss is not happy, or the situation is not good, then you will fall into trouble. My boss used to be very nice to me, but after something happened to me, he chose not to be nice to me. Because you lack something. Yeah, I think it's very important to find your way in no matter where you are. Yes, that's right.
I think META is the biggest psychological position for me. There are too many silent layouts in META. And we're not very stable right now. That's right. Right now, I'm waiting for my friend to be ready to go. As soon as you get the offer, you'll know where your mom can try you out, right? What? Linzi said that at least one of us in this house is Meta. When you get in, I won't be able to come out. No need. Are you guys working on a paper? No, no.
Yeah, it's a good way to live. Yeah, it's still remote. I think it's still remote. I think we can take a look. Will it work today? It's not working right now. That's two days and three days. Yeah. I think I can apply in 18 months. Yeah. You have to see if your manager wants it or not. I'm sorry. Then you can apply in 18 months. 18 months? I can apply in 10 months. I love it. You can take an FMLA for a whole year. You can take an FMLA for a whole year. Yes. You don't have the right to take an FMLA for a whole year. And FMLA doesn't delay the payment of the stock. If you want to buy another stock, you can take an FMLA three months before the payment of the stock. If I can. Do you want to take an FMLA for a whole year and take two West?
I can't look that far. I can only look at it for three months. Maybe it will be different in August. Maybe if the boss of the group leaves, he thinks you are very important and starts to be very good to you. I don't have any interest in this matter. I understand. Lin Zi is so smart. She is a person of great ambition. Can you keep a place like Meta? I can't keep it. Don't say that. We only have two Meta employees here. It's a dog place. I think it's always a dog place. You know what I mean?
I do. I feel like Meta's atmosphere is worse than Yamaha's. It's very copolitical. For example, if someone can catch the boss, he doesn't have to do anything. He can be safe all the time. Especially in this kind of continuous lay-off situation. So you have to have someone to work with. Yes, you have to have someone. Last week, two girls in our group were lay-offs. Huh? Top performers. Where did they get their lay-offs recently? Yes, they got their silent lay-offs.
Last year, Newgrounds got their lay-offs. They got their lay-offs. Last year, Newgrounds got their lay-offs. Yeah.
How did you know. 
There's another one here. It looks like a high-heeled building.
That's right. Are you guys safe here? I think I'm safe. It's no problem. But I... We just talked about this. I think overall, we're going down. And short-term safety is no problem. As for the long-term, we don't know. Actually, Adobe has a backup. But we don't have a backup. It's too small. We don't have a backup for Adobe.
We don't have a backup. Do we have to give you the receipt?
Yes.

Your Task:
Step 1: Transcript Segmentation and Context Identification
Carefully read the provided transcript. Divide it into distinct, meaningful events or episodes. Identify context shifts based on:
- Changes in topic
- Changes in location (if inferable from audio cues or explicit mentions)
- Changes in people Wei is interacting with
- Significant time gaps or clear transitions in activity
Each event should represent a cohesive block of activity or interaction.

Step 2: Structured Event Analysis (JSON Output)
For each individual event identified in Step 1, generate a structured analysis in JSON format. The output should be a JSON array of event objects with the following structure:
[
  {
    "event_id": "unique_event_identifier_001",
    "event_title": "A concise summary of what happened",
    "time_range": "Approximate start and end time (e.g., '07:00-07:30')",
    "duration_minutes": 30,
    "mood_labels": ["primary_mood", "secondary_mood"],
    "mood_score": 7,
    "stress_level": 3,
    "energy_level": 8,
    "activity_type": "work|exercise|social|learning|self-care|chores|commute|meal|leisure",
    "people_involved": ["Name1", "Name2"],
    "interaction_dynamic": "collaborative|supportive|tense|neutral|instructional",
    "inferred_impact_on_wei": "energizing|draining|neutral",
    "topic_labels": ["primary_topic", "secondary_topic"],
    "context_summary": "Brief description of what was happening",
    "key_quote_or_moment": "A relevant quote or significant moment"
  }
]

Step 3: Daily Summaries and Visualization Data
Based on the JSON data generated in Step 2, provide:

Overall Daily Scores:
- Daily Mood Score: Calculate a duration-weighted average of mood_score
- Daily Stress Level Score: Calculate a duration-weighted average of stress_level
- Daily Energy Level Score: Calculate a duration-weighted average of energy_level

Energy Level Timeline:
- Provide as an array of [timestamp, energy_level] pairs

Mood Distribution:
- For each primary mood_label, calculate total duration_minutes

Awake Time Allocation:
- Calculate total duration_minutes for each activity_type

Social Interaction Summary:
- For each unique person:
  - Total interaction time
  - Overall inferred impact
  - Key observation about interaction

Topic Analysis:
- List topics with frequency and duration

=== RESPONSE ===
Here is the structured analysis of Wei's daily transcript:
