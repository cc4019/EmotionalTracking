Today's Date: 05.09.2025
Input Transcript:

=== Consultation Personal Development and Mental Health Discussion ===

After waking up, I don't feel like I have any problems. I don't know. What I hope for now is that when I wake up in the morning, there will be a lot of problems. I hope that I can be in a stable state, so that I can go to work, or have a good life. The longer I stay at home, the less problems I have. Maybe I can find a good place to live.
And then I feel like, oh, I have to stay here today. I have to do this. I think this may be a way to heal people. That is, you are forced to go to that place, and then heal yourself, I guess. What do you think? Then I'm going to climb the wall. I think I will be very happy after climbing the wall.
It will be all right.

Your Task:
Step 1: Transcript Segmentation and Context Identification
Carefully read the provided transcript. Divide it into distinct, meaningful events or episodes. Identify context shifts based on:
- Changes in topic
- Changes in location (if inferable from audio cues or explicit mentions)
- Changes in people Wei is interacting with
- Significant time gaps or clear transitions in activity
Each event should represent a cohesive block of activity or interaction.

Step 2: Structured Event Analysis (JSON Output)
For each individual event identified in Step 1, generate a structured analysis in JSON format. The output should be a JSON array of event objects with the following structure:
[
  {
    "event_id": "unique_event_identifier_001",
    "event_title": "A concise summary of what happened",
    "time_range": "Approximate start and end time (e.g., '07:00-07:30')",
    "duration_minutes": 30,
    "mood_labels": ["primary_mood", "secondary_mood"],
    "mood_score": 7,
    "stress_level": 3,
    "energy_level": 8,
    "activity_type": "work|exercise|social|learning|self-care|chores|commute|meal|leisure",
    "people_involved": ["Name1", "Name2"],
    "interaction_dynamic": "collaborative|supportive|tense|neutral|instructional",
    "inferred_impact_on_wei": "energizing|draining|neutral",
    "topic_labels": ["primary_topic", "secondary_topic"],
    "context_summary": "Brief description of what was happening",
    "key_quote_or_moment": "A relevant quote or significant moment"
  }
]

Step 3: Daily Summaries and Visualization Data
Based on the JSON data generated in Step 2, provide:

Overall Daily Scores:
- Daily Mood Score: Calculate a duration-weighted average of mood_score
- Daily Stress Level Score: Calculate a duration-weighted average of stress_level
- Daily Energy Level Score: Calculate a duration-weighted average of energy_level

Energy Level Timeline:
- Provide as an array of [timestamp, energy_level] pairs

Mood Distribution:
- For each primary mood_label, calculate total duration_minutes

Awake Time Allocation:
- Calculate total duration_minutes for each activity_type

Social Interaction Summary:
- For each unique person:
  - Total interaction time
  - Overall inferred impact
  - Key observation about interaction

Topic Analysis:
- List topics with frequency and duration

=== RESPONSE ===
Here is the structured analysis of Wei's day based on the provided transcript:

Step 1: Transcript Segmentation
I've identified 3 distinct events/episodes in the transcript:

1. Waking up and reflecting on lack of problems and hopes for the future 
2. Feeling forced to stay home and heal self
3. Planning to climb wall and anticipating happiness from it
