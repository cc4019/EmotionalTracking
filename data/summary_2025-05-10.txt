Today's Summary:

The day started off a bit sluggish as I woke up feeling tired and had trouble getting out of bed. I found myself dwelling on thoughts of being overly sensitive to what others think of me. However, I realized the importance of sticking to my own thoughts and not constantly trying to please others - a problem I've struggled with. As the day progressed, I had to run some errands and get my car's license plate renewed, which cost a hefty $800. 

In the evening, I met up with friends Yexin, Xinyu, Linzi, and Wang Jingxin to celebrate my new job by eating hot pot together. It was a lively gathering filled with friendly banter and delicious food. Spending time with loved ones always lifts my spirits. An amusing moment was when my mom called, worried that I was inviting too many guests over instead of spending time with family. Her caring nature, despite being overbearing at times, is endearing.

Overall, the day reinforced the importance of surrounding myself with positive company to boost my mood and energy levels. It also reminded me to be more self-compassionate and not dwell excessively on perceived slights from others. Life is too short to be weighed down by negativity when there is so much goodness to appreciate.
