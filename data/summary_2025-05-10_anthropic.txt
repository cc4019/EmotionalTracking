Today's Summary:

Today started off a bit sluggish as I woke up and fell back asleep, feeling sensitive about things like whether people were messaging me or not. I realized I need to focus more on my own thoughts and not worry so much about pleasing others. After getting ready, I headed out to renew my license plate for $800 and then met up with friends Yexin, Xinyu, Linzi, and Wang Jingxin for a celebratory hot pot dinner. The hot pot was delicious and it was nice to gather with friends during this transition to a new work group. 

Catching up with them helped me feel less isolated and stupid from being alone too much. I got to show off my new muscles from working out and we had fun ordering different meat and vegetable dishes to share. There was some confusion over what everyone wanted, but we figured it out together through good humor. My aunt called briefly about a family situation she's dealing with. Overall, it was an enjoyable evening celebrating my new job with loved ones.

This social connection was important for my wellbeing. I realized I need to be careful about isolating myself too much, as that tends to make me overthink and spiral into negative thoughts. Surrounding myself with positive people lifted my mood and gave me an opportunity to appreciate the good things in my life right now amidst this career transition. The day reminded me that while work is important, nurturing relationships is what truly fulfills me.
